The objective of the CKE Project was to design and build a toll-charging four lane expressway that is 25.8 kilometers in length. Section A1 of the CKE Project involved the construction of the 0km-4.5km (0+000 to 4 +500) segment of the expressway. Section A2 of the CKE Project involved the construction of the 4.5km-10.9km (4+500 to 10+900) segment of the expressway. Section A3 of the CKE Project involved the construction of the 10.9km-16.8km (10+900 to 16+800) segment of the expressway. Section A4 of the CKE Project involved the construction of the 16.8km-25.8km (16+800 to 25+800) segment of the expressway. Project ID#71664 captures the $70.042 million BCL for Section A1 of the CKE Project.   Project ID#71667 captures the $63.574 million BCL for Section A2 of the CKE Project. Project ID#71670 captures the $47.801 million BCL for Section A3 of the CKE Project. Project ID#71672 captures the $66.783 million BCL for Section A4 of the CKE Project.   A contract for the construction of the CKE was initially awarded in October 2000 to a Korean construction company, but it was subsequently terminated in 2003. Then, in 2008, China Metallurgical Group Corporation was awarded a turnkey contract to construct the CKE. The proceeds from the four China Eximbank BCLs were used to pay China Metallurgical Group Corporation for its work on the A1, A2, A3, and A4 Sections of the CKE. The project commenced on August 18, 2009. It was completed and the CKE was opened for public use on October 27, 2013.   The CKE links the Sri Lankan capital Colombo with Bandaranaike International Airport, Katunayake and Negombo. The highway has three lanes each way from Colombo to Peliyagoda, and two lanes each way from Peliyagoda to Katunayake. The speed limit is 80 km/h (50 mph) for the first eight kilometers (5.0 mi) and 100 km/h (62 mph) for the rest of the road. The CKE has 42 bridges and 88 culverts including a 480-meter long viaduct at Hunupitiya and an 800-meter viaduct at Katunayake. The opening of the expressway has allowed people to travel between Colombo, the commercial capital of Sri Lanka and Katunayake, the major international airport of Sri Lanka, within 15 minutes.   However, the CKE project has also encountered debt repayment problems. On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a ‘pre-emptive’ sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. Its decision to suspend external debt service reportedly affected all China Eximbank loans with amounts outstanding at the time of the announcement.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Government Agency",100309208.68509,"The objective of the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway (CKE) Project was to design and build a toll-charging four lane expressway that is 25.8 kilometers in length.

Then, according to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), Bank of China and the Government of Côte d'Ivoire signed two loan agreements on May 22, 2019 for Phase 1 of the Abidjan PK24 Industrial Zone Project: a CFA 52,795,025,919 loan agreement (captured via Project ID#52214) and a CFA 7,919,254,068.52 loan agreement (captured via Project ID#92228). The borrowing terms of the two loans are unknown. However, it is known that the CFA 52,795,025,919 loan was backed by a Sinosure credit insurance policy. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the CFA 52,795,025,919 loan to finance 87% of the cost of a commercial contract between China Harbour Engineering Co., Ltd. (CHEC) and the Government of Côte d'Ivoire, which was signed in September 2015. It was expected to use the proceeds of the CFA 7,919,254,068.52 loan to finance 13% of the cost of the same commercial contract.   The CFA 52,795,025,919 had achieved a 96% disbursement rate as of July 31, 2022. 3 disbursements (worth CFA 46,269,632,117.23) were made through the CFA 52,795,025,919 loan agreement: a CFA 11,266,380,848 disbursement on December 31, 2020, a CFA 28,851,997,584.23 disbursement on December 31, 2021, and a CFA 6,151,253,685 disbursement on July 31, 2022.

Construction works include roads, drainage, drinking water supply, wastewater treatment, and electricity. The industrial zone consists of 940 hectares in total and it is being built in multiple phases.   CHEC is the EPC contractor responsible for the implementation of Phase 1. The Ivorian Minister of Trade, Industry and Promotion Souleymane DIARRASSOUBA, China Communication Construction Company Deputy Managing Director Mr. Li Yi, and China Road and Bridge Corporation Vice President Mr. Wen Gang signed an implementation agreement with CHEC on December 14, 2018. Then, a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on August 1, 2019. However, construction did not begin until December 1, 2019. Construction was originally scheduled to last 18 months, but the COVID-19 pandemic led to implementation delays. This project had achieved a 49.36% completion rate as of 2021.

The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: 20 year maturity, 5 year grace period, 2% interest rate. The final maturity date of the loan is March 21, 2026. Then, on January 15, 2007, China Eximbank and the Government of the Philippines signed an RMB 800 million ($117,250,400) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [China Eximbank GCL No. (2006) 29] for Phase 2 of the Non-Intrusive Container Inspection System Project (NCISP). The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: 20 year maturity, 5 year grace period, 2% interest rate, and 0.3% management fee. The final maturity date of the loan is September 21, 2026. The GCL that was signed on May 11, 2006 is captured in Project ID#49079. The GCL that was signed on January 15, 2007 is captured in Project ID#49078.   The proceeds of both GCLs were to be used to be the borrower to finance a commercial contract between the Philippines' Bureau of Customs and Nuctech Company Limited. The purpose of the NCISP was to purchase and install x-ray scanners for use in the country’s major customs collection districts, including the Port of Manila, Manila International Container Port, Port of Subic, Port of Clark, Port of Batangas, Port of Cebu, Port of Davao, Port of Cagayan de Oro, Sub-Port of General Santos, Port of Zamboanga. Each of these scanners was capable of inspecting at least 20 forty-foot containers or 17 forty-foot containers per hour.   The objectives of the project included improving accuracy and correctness of assessment and collection of duties and taxes; combatting smuggling and the illegal entry of drugs and hazardous materials; and improving the inflow and outflow of containers through the country’s ports. Phase 1 supported the acquisition and installation of 10 x-ray scanners for use in the country’s major customs collection districts. Phase 2 supported the acquisition and installation of 20 x-ray scanners. Under Phase 2, three scanners each were earmarked for use in the South Harbor Port and the Manila International Container Port; two scanners were earmarked for use at the NAIA airport; and one scanner each was earmarked for use in the Cebu City, Subic, Clark, Batangas, San Fernando, Legaspi, Iloilo, Tacloban, Surigao, Cagayan de Oro, Zamboanga and Davao Ports.   Nuctech Company Limited was the contractor responsible for the implementation of both phases and its work was overseen by the Philippines' Bureau of Customs. After President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed Executive Order No. 592 on December 16, 2006 and imposed the mandatory payment of a Container Security Fee to support the NCISP, Commissioner Morales issued Customs Memorandum Order No. 6-2007 on March 28, 2007 and created an x-ray committee to carry out effectively the mandate of the Project. CMO No. 6-2007 enumerated guidelines for the conduct of x-ray inspection on containerized shipments and established an X-Ray Inspection Project (XIP) as a specialized and technical unit that would oversee the administrative and operational control of all x-ray scanning equipment. This container inspection system was put into effect in July 2007 and it reportedly led to a reduction in the number of shipments subjected to actual physical inspection (due to the fact that the scanners clearly demonstrated which cargoes needed to be examined physically).   However, this project was also plagued by controversy due to allegations of artificially inflated costs. In 2016, the Philippines’ Commission on Audit (COA) asked the Bureau of Customs (BOC) to review the 2006 commercial contract with Nuctech Company Limited and the China Eximbank loan agreements that were used to finance the commercial contract (after COA found that the mobile X-ray machines purchased in 2006 were exorbitantly overpriced’ (by PHP 4.215 billion). The Government of the Philippines paid PHP 7.953 billion to Nuctech Company Limited for 30 units of mobile X-ray equipment. But when COA asked for a quotation from another international supplier of non-intrusive container inspection scanners, it found that the Government of the Philippines could have purchased the X-ray machines at a lower price for even better performance. COA's quotation from the said supplier showed that an X-ray machine ‘with vastly superior performance’ would only cost PHP 124.6 million each, for a total of PHP 3.738 billion for thirty units. A special COA audit noted that these x-ray machines could ‘be utilized at sea ports that can scan trucks and containers five times the speed of the mobile X-rays that BOC have’.  Aside from overpriced nature of the x-ray machines, the COA audit found that the maintenance cost of the X-ray machines from Nuctech Company Limited was substantially higher (by PHP 3.264 million) compared to other suppliers.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRADE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS",NA,"State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Government Agency",101949492.512685,"The loan financed ten machines that were given to Port of Manila, Manila International Container Port, Port of Subic, Port of Clark, Port of Batangas, Port of Cebu, Port of Davao, Port of Cagayan de Oro, Sub-Port of General Santos, Port of Zamboanga.

The stadium was named after Levy Mwanawasa, the third President of Zambia, who served from 2002 to his death in 2008. It was expected to be a multi-purpose stadium but mostly for football matches. It is located on the T3 Highway at the start of the Ndola-Kitwe Dual Carriageway.   Anhui Foreign Economic Construction Group (AFECC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. An official groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 4, 2009. However, construction itself did not begin until August 28, 2009. Construction was completed on August 13, 2011. On January 4, 2012, the Chinese Government and the Government of Zambia signed the project handover certificate. Then, a formal opening ceremony was organized on June 2, 2012. The stadium hosted its first international game on June 9, 2012.   Then, in July 2019, the Chinese Government forgave all of the Government of Zambia's outstanding debt obligations related to this project, although the amount of debt forgiveness that was reported at the time was over $70 million (as captured via Project ID #66330).

The borrowing terms of the loan are as follows: a 20 year maturity (final maturity date:  March 21, 2031), a 5 year grace period (first repayment date: September 21, 2016), and a 2% interest rate.   The loan's principal amount outstanding was RMB 341,396,673.36 as of June 2023. As of 2022, the borrower expected to make principal repayments each year worth RMB 35,936,491 until 2031.  The project involved the construction of the Malawi University of Science and Technology (MUST) in the district of Thyolo. The university was designed to accommodate 3,000 students.   The contractor responsible for project implementation was Anhui Foreign Economic Construction Group Co., Ltd. (AFECC). Project implementation began on April 9, 2011. The project was scheduled for completion in time for the 2013/14 academic year and the official project handover ceremony took place on December 13, 2013.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Malawi University of Science and Technology (MUST) Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2021, Malawi's Minister of Finance announced that ‘in 2020/21 FY, Government [of Malawi] requested temporary debt service suspension from bilateral creditors. This is in line with the Extended Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI). The key feature of the Extended DSSI is that the repayment period of the principal and interest payments falling due between 1st January 2021 to 30th June 2021 will be made in five years with one-year grace period. This entails that in 2021/22 FY, the suspended debt service will be within the grace period.’ Then, in November 2022, the World Bank and the IMF judged the Government of Malawi’s external debt and overall public debt to be ‘in distress’—a downgrade from the previous World Bank-IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA). In July 2023 correspondence with AidData’s Executive Director, the Government of Malawi revealed that it was in negotiations with China Eximbank about rescheduling all of their loans with amounts outstanding. The Government of Malawi proposed principal payments worth RMB 61 million and interest payments worth RMB 26 million in 2023, interest payments worth RMB 26 million and principal payment deferrals in 2024 and 2025, RMB 50 million in principal and interest payments in 2026, RMB 90 million in principal and interest payments in 2027, RMB 89 million in principal and interest payments in 2028, RMB 88 million in principal and interest payments in 2029, RMB 87 million in principal and interest payments in 2030, RMB 86 million in principal and interest payments in 2031, and RMB 85 million in principal and interest payments in 2032. China Eximbank proposed principal payments worth RMB 61 million and interest payments worth RMB 26 million in 2023, interest payments worth RMB 26 million and principal payment deferrals in 2024 and 2025, RMB 148 million in principal and interest payments in 2026, RMB 299 million in principal and interest payments in 2027, RMB 294 million in principal and interest payments in 2028, RMB 228 million in principal and interest payments in 2029, RMB 121 million in principal and interest payments in 2030, RMB 101 million in principal and interest payments in 2031, and RMB 82 million in principal and interest payments in 2032.

Then, in 2020, China Eximbank and TRC signed a debt rescheduling agreement (captured via Project ID#96152) that extended the loan’s maturity date by two years: from July 21, 2024 to July 31, 2026. In July 2022, the Financial Times reported that the tower “was designed to look like a giant lotus bud about to burst into flower, [and] it was intended to be a metaphor for the flourishing of Sri Lanka’s economy and the 'brilliant future' of the bilateral co-operation between Beijing and Colombo. Instead, the tower has become a symbol of the mounting problems facing China’s overseas lending scheme, the ‘Belt and Road Initiative.' The construction suffered from lengthy delays and an allegation of corruption [leveled] by Sri Lanka’s then-president Maithripala Sirisena against one of the Chinese contractors.   Now, three years after its official launch, the tower’s amenities including a shopping mall, a conference center, and several restaurants stand either unfinished or largely unused while outside on the streets outrage over Sri Lanka’s financial mismanagement has boiled over into popular protests. ‘It is something we would have done better without,’ says Athula Kumarasiri, a bookshop owner, as he motions towards the tower. ‘What is the need for this? It is a complete white elephant.' In September 2022, Colombo Lotus Tower Management Company said that the delayed opening of the tower would lead to significant financial losses. ‘We can’t keep this closed. The maintenance costs are huge,’ Chief Administrative Officer Prasad Samarasinghe told reporters.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","COMMUNICATIONS","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Miscellaneous Agency Type|Other Government Agency",104097794.645705,"The Lotus Tower (or Nelum Kuluna) is located on the waterfront of the Beira Lake in Colombo.

All subsidiary loans approved under the buyer’s credit facility agreement (captured via Project ID#45047) carried the following borrowing terms: a 13-year maturity and an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 2-3% margin. All of the subsidiary loans were secured with (i.e., collateralized against) Ethiopia's export receipts to China, which at the time primarily consisted of sesame seed export receipts. The buyer’s credit facility agreement also required that all Ethiopian exports (export receipts) to China to be overseen by the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, the country’s largest state-owned financial institution. 16 subsidiary loans for 16 different projects were reportedly approved under the buyer’s credit facility agreement. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), China Eximbank and the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE)— an Ethiopian state-owned bank — signed a subsidiary buyer’s credit loan worth approximately $125.205 million (ETB 1,082,214,356) for the 97MW Neshe Multipurpose Dam Construction Project on September 20, 2007.  The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $147.3 million (ETB 1.3 billon) commercial contract between the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCo) — an Ethiopian state-owned enterprise — and China Gezhouba Group Corporation (CGGC), which was signed in December 2006. The $125.205 million (ETB 1,082,214,356) was provided in two tranches for two different lots (contracts). 53.7% of the face value of the loan ($71,742,465 or ETB 581,478,798) was earmarked for the Neshe Multipurpose Civil Work Contract (‘Lot 1’). 46.3% of the face value of the loan ($57,969,915 or ETB 500,735,558) was earmarked for the Neshe Multipurpose Electro Mechanical Work Contract (‘Lot 2’).    According to the Government of Ethiopia’s AMP, the ETB 581,478,798 ($71,742,465) loan for Lot 1 achieved a 58% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 7 loan disbursements (worth ETB 336,241,047) between 2010 and 2012: an ETB 59,128,437 disbursement on April 8, 2010, an ETB 73,663,866 disbursement on April 8, 2011, an ETB 76,373,469 disbursement on July 7, 2011, an ETB 18,236,942 disbursement on October 10, 2011, an ETB 59,108,763 disbursement on October 10, 2011, an ETB 21,447,578 disbursement on January 8, 2010, and an ETB 28,281,993 disbursement on April 8, 2012. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s AMP, the ETB 500,735,558 loan ($57,969,915) for Lot 2 achieved a 104% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 8 loan disbursements (worth ETB 521,882,224) between 2009 and 2012: an ETB 24,803,050 disbursement on December 31, 2009, an ETB 24,229,515 disbursement on April 8, 2010, an ETB 159,702,521 disbursement on April 8, 2011, an ETB 187,753,061 disbursement on July 7,, 2011, an ETB 39,950,859 disbursement on October 10,, 2011, an ETB 18,469,723 disbursement on January 8, 2012, an ETB 39,639,860 disbursement on April 8, 2012, and an ETB 27,333,635 disbursement on October 10, 2012. The purpose of the project was to construct the 97MW Fincha-Amerti-Neshi (FAN) hydroelectric power plant — also known as the Neshe multipurpose dam — on the Neshi River in the Blue Nile catchment within Eastern Wolega Zone in Oromia Regional State. Upon completion, it was envisaged that the multi-purpose dam would enable the irrigation of a 6,000 hectare plot nearby, where sugarcane is grown by the state-owned Fincha Sugar Factory (also known as the Finchaa Sugar Estate).   CGGC was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Dam construction started on July 22, 2010. The project was originally scheduled for completion on August 25, 2011. It was ultimately completed on November 17, 2011. A formal inauguration ceremony was held on December 17, 2011. Project implementation challenges and delays reportedly include a 24 month delay in the approval of the China Eximbank loan, power interruptions, and logistical problems while transporting construction materials from Djibouti port. According to field interview evidence collected by Detlef Müller-Mahn and Million Gebreyes, the implementation of the project also provoked two sets of concerns among local residents: ‘First, there is a general feeling of unfairness, because apparently information about the new project and its opportunities was not made generally available. Secondly, and worse than that, many people complain about broken promises and disappointed expectations, especially with regard to the payment of compensation and the organization of the out-grower scheme adjacent to the sugar cane plantation. Many respondents confirmed that compensation for land that was taken for the new dam was not paid as originally agreed, which, as they explain, was due to insufficient asset valuations, incorrect surveys, mismanagement, and corruption. Tensions in connection with the project were further aggravated when some of the resettled families realized that the new houses they had been given in the lowland area close to the sugar cane plantation were not as nice as they had expected, and that living conditions in that location were not favorable. For that reason, many families left the new settlement again and went back to the highlands. They abandoned their new homes and the land they had been given. However, as out-growers they were no longer free in their decision about what to cultivate and where to live, but had to grow sugar cane for the factory. In 2017, when the farm managers of the sugar cane plantation realized that the land of the out-growers was no longer cultivated, they started to plant it with sugar cane. This again caused a major uproar among the settlers who claimed that the sugar company should pay rent to them. The company did so in the first year, but when it refused to do so in the second year, people threatened that they would burn the plantation and attack the factory. As a consequence, almost 2000 hectares of the out-grower scheme were left without cultivation.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient State-owned Company",104303203.338318,"The purpose of the project was to construct the 97MW Fincha-Amerti-Neshi (FAN) hydroelectric power plant — also known as the Neshe multipurpose dam — on the Neshi River in the Blue Nile catchment within Eastern Wolega Zone in Oromia Regional State.

Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd, in turn, secured a receivables financing facility from Bank of China. The loan to ICE carried the following borrowing terms: a fixed interest rate of 5.45% and a maturity length of 5.5 years. The final maturity date of the loan was April 10, 2017 (later amended to January 30, 2018), and the borrower was responsible for making semi-annual loan repayments. The loan proceeds were to be used by the borrower to acquire telecommunications equipment and services from Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. and thereby support the expansion of a 3G advanced mobile system in Costa Rica. The loan was reportedly insured by Sinosure. As of September 2014, this facility had not been drawn upon, and September 2014 was the most recent mention of it in ICE reports.  The 3G network expansion project was plagued by controversy. In 2009, ICE awarded a $235 million contract to Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. to deploy a 3G network over a five year period, but Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. reportedly breached the contract from 2011-14. ICE then opened a summary procedure to collect a $6.7 million fine for the contractual breaches, which Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. accepted (as evidenced by official communication 5225-1031-2016 from November 22, 2016). However, instead of paying the fine, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. offered to settle the matter by making donations ($5.2 million of fixed internet equipment and $1.5 million of support services) equal to the amount of the fine.  In 2017, ICE’s former telecom director, Jaime Palermo, accepted the offer in November 2017 (as evidenced by official letter 6000-1513-2017 from November 9, 2017). Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. then offered Palermo an $8.3 million project to expand fixed internet coverage in the country’s metropolitan areas. ICE would only have to pay $1.6 million as the remainder that was not already covered by the $6.7 million donation. Palermo approved a contract for the project that same year, making Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. ICE’s biggest fixed-internet infrastructure provider and side-stepping an open competition in which other proposals could have been considered. In December 2019, La Nación reported that the public prosecutor's office in Costa Rica launched an investigation, which in turn led to an in-house audit report by ICE.

The loan is subject to an interest rate of 7.15% per annum for 60 months from the date of agreement and after 60 months the interest rate is set to LIBOR plus a margin of 3.2% per annum. The loan is repayable over a period of 14 years in 24 equal semi-annual installments. The first loan repayment was scheduled for March 20, 2012 (3 year grace period) and the last loan repayment was scheduled for September 20, 2023. Fiji’s Ministry of Finance issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan and on behalf of the Government of Fiji. The borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance a $124.8 million commercial contract that it signed with Sinohydro Corporation Limited on September 8, 2008.   On January 27, 2009, the FEA made the first drawdown from the China Development Bank loan amounting to $43.8 million. Immediately upon receipt of the loan proceeds from China Development Bank, on January 28, 2009, FEA sold $13.8 million to Reserve Bank of Fiji, thereby settling the FEA’s commitment to Reserve Bank of Fiji (see Staff Note 2). The balance of the loan proceeds ($30 million) was placed in short term foreign currency term deposits with ANZ Bank. FEA made its last loan drawdown ($11.2 million) in March 2010  after satisfying all the three debt covenants essential to ensure the loan drawdown. Additional funding for the 41.7MW Nadarivatu Hydropower Project was secured via FEA bonds ($50 million), and ANZ Bank ($30 million).

The dam was designed to generate hydroelectric power in a 41.7 megawatts (55,900 hp) run-of-the-river scheme. The 40-meter-high concrete gravity dam, including three radial gates and two sluice gates, diverts water from the confluence of the Nukunuku River and Qaliwana River, which are tributaries of Sigatoka River, through a 3,225 m long headrace/2-meter-diameter buried steel penstock tunnel to a power station along the Ba River to the southwest. The power station contains two 20.85 MW Pelton (with 6 jet-units) turbine-generators with a maximum discharge of 15.0 m3 /s. The drop in elevation between the reservoir and the power station affords a gross head of 335.7 m. A 132 kV, 5-kilometer-long transmission line connects it to the existing FEA’s transmission system through a switching station (known as the Nadarivatu Switching Station). The Nadarivatu Switching Station connects to the national power grid and is situated near the 132kV Wailoa - Vuda transmission line.  The design services for the project were undertaken by MWH New Zealand Limited. Detailed plans for the project were developed in 2002; detailed design work and construction of basic infrastructure such as access roads for the 42 MW Nadarivatu hydropower project were completed in 2006.  Then, on December 17, 2008, FEA made an advance payment of $43.8 million was made to Sinohydro Corporation Limited, which resulted in it mobilizing a workforce for the construction of the project. Construction began in January 2009.   The power station was ultimately commissioned on September 7, 2012, and an inauguration ceremony led by Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama was held a week later on September 14, 2012.   The completion of the power station was expected to save the country about 42 million Fiji dollars ($24 million) per year from the importation of diesel fuel.  However, the project was not without controversy. In March 2009, local landowners and the Construction Energy and Timber Workers Union (which represented local workers supporting the construction of the power plant) raised concerns over Sinohydro Corporation Limited's non-compliance with the occupational health and safety laws of Fiji. Nadarivatu Landowner Council secretary Misaele Toutou also said that when villagers from five clans started work in January 2009, they were not provided proper safety gear from boots, gloves and helmets. The General Secretary of the Construction Energy and Timber Workers Union said that Sinohydro Corporation Limited was extensively abusing local workers by not providing essential safety gear and proper working conditions that they deserved. He said workers had been exploited and asked to work under dangerous and hazardous conditions without safety clothing and equipment; and directed to get their own safety gear if they wanted jobs on the project. Local employees reportedly staged protests about a lack of compliance with health and safety laws. Union representatives and a local landowners council also wrote to the Immigration Department to ask for explanations about increases in the number of foreign workers.","Completion","Development","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company",105140703.379235,"The purpose of this project was to construct the Nadarivatu Dam, also known as the Korolevu Dam, which is a concrete gravity dam on the upper reaches of the Sigatoka River in Buyabuya Village, Nadarivatu District, and Nadroga-Navosa Province.

The purpose of the project was the expand and modernize a cement factory in Bajil (باجل;) District (also known as Bajal or Bajel District and incorrectly transliterated from Chinese as Bagir or Baghir District) within Al Hudaydah Governorate. The ultimate objective of the project was to increase the annual cement production capacity of the plant from 250,000 tons to 850,000 tons per year and to construct a coal-fired power station at the cement plant.   A commercial contract with CMEC was signed in December 2007, and project implementation commenced shortly thereafter. Then, on January 18, 2009, a supplementary contract with CMEC was signed for the construction of a 32MW coal-fired power station at the cement plant. However, implementation halted in early 2011 due to conflict and instability in Yemen (when the project had already achieved a 55% completion rate). Then, an agreement was signed in September 2012 to resume construction. In February 2014, representatives from CMEC, the Bajil Cement Factory, the Yemeni Ministry of Industry, and the Chinese Economic and Commercial Counselor’s Office met to discuss obstacles to project implementation. According to CMEC's website, the originally planned completion date was December 2014. However, it does not appear that this project ever reached completion. All CMEC employees involved in the implementation of this project were evacuated on March 30, 2015 after a series of Saudi-led airstrikes against Houthi rebels.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company",106572534.537553,"The purpose of the project was the expand and modernize a cement factory in Bajil (باجل;) District (also known as Bajal or Bajel District and incorrectly transliterated from Chinese as Bagir or Baghir District) within Al Hudaydah Governorate.

On November 18, 2013, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) signed an updated Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with regard to utilizing a Chinese Government Concessional Loan to execute the Port of St John’s Renovation and Extension Project. Then, on November 11, 2014, the Government of Antigua and Barbuda submitted a project proposal and application for a Chinese Government Concessional Loan to the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Antigua. On December 22, 2014, Antigua and Barbuda Port Authority and CCECC signed an RMB 1,590,000,000 commercial (‘design and construction’) contract (#AB/PMP-01) for the Port of St John’s Renovation and Extension Project. Then, on May 25, 2015, Antigua and Barbuda Port Authority and CCECC signed a revised commercial contract (#AB/PMP-02) worth RMB 585,000,000. Then, on November 25, 2016, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Government of Antigua and Barbuda signed an RMB 600 million government concessional loan (GCL) for the Port of St John’s Renovation and Extension Project. Less than a month later, on December 15, 2016, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Government of Antigua and Barbuda signed a framework agreement for a RMB 600 million government concessional loan (GCL) for the Port of St John’s Renovation and Extension Project. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 2 percent interest rate, a grace period of 5 years, and a maturity of 21.75 years. The final maturity date of the GCL is March 19, 2038. The proceeds of the GCL were to be used by the borrower to finance the RMB 585,000,000 commercial contract that was signed on May 25, 2015. The remaining RMB 15,000,000 was to be used by the borrower to finance a contract with Guangxi Bagui Project Supervision and Consultant Co. Ltd for project management and supervision activities related to the Port of St John’s Renovation and Extension Project. The borrower also agreed to deposit the operating income generated by the project in an escrow account to support debt service requirements.   The purpose of the project is to bring about the long-awaited transformation of the St. John’s Port from a break-bulk facility to a modern container port facility that is capable of increasing annual cargo throughput from 16,000 containers to 80,000 containers. It involves the construction of a new Customs and Port Authority headquarters, the expansion of a quay (extension of the existing pier), the construction of a new warehouse for processing goods, the extension of a sea wall, the dredging of the harbor, and the establishment of a logistics park. Some of the expected project benefits include improved ship-to-shore interface; greater efficiency in the clearance of goods; automated scanning and computerized handling/clearance of goods; reduced ground transportation costs, and greater ease of doing business.   CCECC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on January 15, 2018. However, the project did not commence until September 8, 2018. It was originally envisaged that the project would take three years to implement.  Satellite imagery suggests that, as of July 2020, a 320-meter quay expansion and the construction of a new warehouse were complete (or nearly completed).  Satellite imagery from July 2020 also suggests that, on the northern side of the port, land had been built up for what is likely the new sea wall and a set of buildings and a parking lot had been constructed, while another pier to the south was being added to the existing cruise terminal. The construction of the container terminal was officially completed and handed over to the local authorities on October 13, 2020. St. John’s Port has reportedly become the only port with professional container transshipment terminal and automated cross-transshipment capacity in eastern Caribbean region, thus helping Antigua and Barbuda in building itself into a regional logistics center and promoting the country’s economic and social development.","Implementation","Development","Loan","ODA-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company",106617841.026846,"St. John’s Port is located in located in the capital city of St. Johns.

The agreement was signed by Gabonese Finance Minister Paul Toungui and China's ambassador Hxue Jinwei. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 3% interest rate.  Also, on May 24, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Gabon also signed a USD-denominated preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement worth $300 million for the 160MW Grand Poubara Hydroelectric Dam Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. The proceeds from the GCL and the PBC were used to finance approximately $370 million of a $398 million Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contract with Sinohydro. The Government of Gabon covered the remaining $28 million cost of the EPC contract.  The Government of Gabon also issued sovereign guarantees for the two loans from China Eximbank.  Project ID#85 captures the GCL, while Project ID#73173 captures the PBC.   The project involved the construction of a dam on the Ogooué river with 4 Francis turbines capable of generating 160 MW. The dam was built in part to generate power for an iron ore mine in Belinga (see Project ID#630).  The project also involved the construction of two power transmission lines: a 15 km line from the dam site to Franceville, the country's third largest city, and another line from the dam site to Moanda (the largest manganese mining region in Gabon and in the world).  The dam is located 15 km outside of Franceville in the province of Haut-Ogooué, more than 700 km southwest of Libreville, an area where the Compagnie minière de l’Ogooué’s (COMILOG) main manganese mine is located.   Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for implementation. Construction officially began on November 15, 2008, and it was originally anticipated that the construction process will be completed in 54 months (May 15, 2013).   The dam was impounded on April 30, 2013.  Then, the four power generating units went into operation on August 5, 2013. The dam, water diversion system and other civil works passed final inspection by the project owner on July 22, 2014. The power generator set and auxiliary equipment also passed final inspection by the project owner on August 9, 2014, effectively marking the completion of the project.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loans for the 160MW Grand Poubara Hydroelectric Dam Construction Project  may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  In mid-2014, a decline in international oil prices generated sharp reductions in Gabon’s oil exports and fiscal revenues. The country’s rising fiscal deficit led to the accumulation of arrears to external creditors. By 2017, the stock of the Government of Gabon’s external arrears stood at $115 million, including arrears to China, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Israel, and South Korea. All of these arrears were successfully cleared by 2020. However, the Government of Gabon accumulated $3 million of additional arrears to Chinese creditors in 2020.  By the end of May 2021, ‘the stock of [the Government of] Gabon’s external arrears stood at CFAF 98.03 billion (US$182.1 million), including CFAF 23.8 billion (US$44.2 million) vis-à-vis multilaterals and CFAF 21.05 billion (US$39.1 million) vis-à-vis government agencies and private creditors insured with companies from Paris Club member countries and from China [ICBC and China Construction Bank] CFAF 1.3 billion (US$2.42 million). The Government's strategy for the clearance of existing external arrears consists of focusing primarily on multilateral debt, bilateral debt, insured commercial commitments and seeking agreements with other creditors prior to the IMF Board meeting. Accordingly, we will clear the arrears vis-à-vis the multilaterals. We will also clear bilateral and commercial-insured arrears as follows: (i) Austria CFAF 6.83 billion (US$12.69 million); (ii) France CFAF 11.9 billion (US$22.11 million); (iii) Israel CFAF 2.23 billion (US$4.13 million); and Spain CFAF 0.09 billion (US$0.17 million). Regarding the other commercial arrears vis-à-cis AFREXIMBANK (CFAF 7.52 billion or US$13.97 million, and commercial non-insured vis-à-vis France CFAF 0.7 billion (US$1.24 million), Austria CFAF 8.71 billion (US$16.18 million), and Morocco CFAF 1.01 billion (US$1.87 million), we contacted these creditors individually to obtain from them the non-objection agreement. The same communication was made with China to which our bilateral payment arrears are about CFAF 34.01 billion (US$63.17 million).’ Then, in 2022, the IMF reported that the Government of Gabon’s external arrears to Chinese creditors stood at $23.9 million as of December 2021 and $1 million in June 2022.","Completion","Development","Loan","ODA-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company",106721014.536433,"The Grand Poubara Hydroelectric Dam is located 15 km outside of Franceville in the province of Haut-Ogooué.

The loan would carry the following borrowing terms: a 9-year maturity and a 2.5% interest rate.   Later that month, China Eximbank reportedly signed a GCL agreement worth RMB 405 million (captured via Project ID#43258) and a buyer’s credit loan agreement worth $184.2 million (captured via Project ID#42133) for the Belarusian Telecommunications Network (BEST) Construction and Equipment Supply Project. Both of these loans reportedly carried 9-year maturities (from 2006 to 2014) and 3-year grace periods (from 2006 to 2008).     Belarus’ Ministry of Finance evidently on-lent the proceeds from the GCL and buyer’s credit loan to a newly-established state-owned company called CJSC Belarusian Telecommunications Network (BeST). BeST, in turn, used the proceeds from the GCL and the buyer’s credit loan to finance a $234 million commercial contract that it signed with Alcatel Shanghai Bell Company Limited (a Chinese subsidiary of Alcatel, a French telecommunications and engineering company) in the fall of 2005.   The purpose of this project was to build a cellular (GSM) communication network and facilitate the acquisition of telecommunication equipment from Alcatel Shanghai Bell Company Limited.

This framework agreement (captured in Project ID#60219) was ratified on October 26, 2006.   One of the subsidiary loans that was approved through the framework agreement was a $53 million loan in 2006 for the Ollombo Airport Construction Project.

The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was to use the proceeds of the PBC to partially finance a $113 million commercial (EPC) contract between China International Water & Electric Corporation (CWE) and Électricité du Laos (EDL).   The purpose of the project was to construct a 154.3 km 230kV transmission line between the Thavieng substation and the Thabok substation. Upon completion, it was envisaged that the project would connect northern Laos to the country’s central power grid and ease power transmission from Vientiane and Thailand to northern Laos.   CWE was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation.  Construction began in December 2012. A temporary project completion certificate was issued on September 15, 2015. Then, on December 11, 2017, the project passed final inspection by the project owner (EDL). A project completion ceremony was held on December 19, 2015. On January 16, 2018, the project warranty period ended and the project was transferred to the owner.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the 230kV Thavieng-Thabok Transmission Line and Substations Project2 may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. Laos’ gross foreign exchange reserves were dangerously low between 2019 and 2021, hovering between 1.4 and 2.3 months of import cover, and total public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt increased from 68 percent of GDP ($12.5 billion) in 2019 to 88 percent in 2021 of GDP (or $14.5 billion). According to a report published by the World Bank in April 2022, ‘[t]he energy sector, mostly represented by Électricité du Laos (EDL), accounted for over 30 percent of total PPG debt in 2021. […] EDL’s debt service obligations [were] still unsustainable [at the time], with future debt service accounting for about two fifths of EDL’s total operating revenue.’ The Laotian authorities sought and secured debt service payment deferrals from their Chinese creditors in 2020 and 2021; according to the World Bank, ‘[d]ebt service deferrals granted by major lenders in 2020-2021 amounted around 3.6 percent of GDP in 2021’ and ’[a]s a result, actual debt service payments are estimated to have declined to 48 percent of total revenues in 2021, compared to 65 percent in the 2021 [Government of Laos] plan.’  The country’s central bank (Bank of the Lao P.D.R) also made a $300 million drawdown under its currency swap agreement with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in June 2020 — when its gross reserves stood at only 1.5 months of import cover and credit rating agencies warned of a high default probability. Then, in 2021, the short-term emergency loan from the PBOC was ‘rolled over’ for another year. Around the same time, a Chinese state-owned enterprise purchased a major public infrastructure asset in Laos—a large part of the country’s electricity transmission grid—from EDL as part of an apparent debt-for-equity swap. China Southern Power Grid Co. and EDL established a joint venture known as Électricité du Laos Transmission Company Limited (EDLT) in September 2020.  China Southern Power Grid Co. purchased a 90% ownership stake in EDLT in exchange for a $600 million fee (equity infusion). Then, in March 2021, EDLT signed a 25-year concession agreement, which made it responsible for management of the country’s high-voltage transmission network above 230 kilovolts. Independent observers suggested at the time that EDL would likely use the $600 million upfront payment from China Southern Power Grid Co. to service its outstanding debts to Chinese creditors, although this has not been independently confirmed. According to the World Bank’s International Debt Statistics, the Government of Laos was responsible for making average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $232 million between 2019 and 2019 and average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $60 million between 2020 and 2021 (a substantially lower figure due to payment deferrals); however, it expected to make average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth nearly $678 million over the next seven years (2022-2028).","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient State-owned Company",107794568.458058,"The purpose of the project was to construct a 154.3 km 230kV transmission line between the Thavieng substation and the Thabok substation.

According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs.

The loan  carried the following borrowing terms: a maturity of 20 years, a grace period of 5 to 7 years, and an interest rate of 2%.   The Government of Tajikistan used nearly all of the proceeds from the loan ($55,227,590) to on-lend (through subsidiary loan agreement No. BLA06016) to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) “Barqi Tojik” -- a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy -- at a 3% interest rate between December 16, 2006 and June 21, 2026. OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” was expected to use the loan proceeds to finance 95% of the cost of a $58.1 million commercial contract with TBEA Co., Ltd. The Government of Tajikistan was expected to provide the remaining 5% ($2.9 million).

SEDL also entered into a 727,352,000 Pakistani rupee (PKR-denominated) loan facility agreement with ICBC-Pakistan (worth $7.134 million USD). The total cost of this independent power project (IPP) was $130.481 million and it was reportedly financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20.   The $100 million (USD-denominated) loan agreement, which is captured via Project ID#52660, carried the following borrowing terms: a 12 year maturity, a 2 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (1.4154%) plus a 3.75% margin, and a 6.552% Sinosure insurance premium. Arif Habib Corporation Limited issued a corporate guarantee in support of the loan. The loan was also secured (i.e. collateralized) against first charge of $107,134,400 (duly registered with Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan) over all present and future current and operating fixed assets of SEDL and a pledge of all shares in SEDL.   The 727,352,000 Pakistani rupee (PKR-denominated) loan agreement is captured in Project ID #72072. The borrowing terms are as follows: a 12 year maturity, a 2 year grace period, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (1.4154%) plus a 3% margin.  Sachal Energy Development (Ptd) Limited is a project company (special purpose vehicle), 100% owned by Arif Habib Corporation Limited, and was established to finance, design, implement, and maintain the Sachal 49.5MW Wind Power Project. The purpose of this project is to utilize wind resources for electricity generation through the construction of a wind farm with a total capacity of 49.5 MW and to deliver the electricity generated from the project to the power purchaser, i.e. National Transmission & Dispatch Company Limited (NTDC). The project involved the installation of 33 Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) from Goldwind. Each WTG had a capacity of 1.5 MW. Hydrochina Corporation was the offshore EPC contractor and Hydrochina International Engineering Company Ltd Pakistan was the onshore EPC contractor for the project.   Sachal Energy Development Pvt Ltd signed a power purchase agreement with National Electric Power Regulatory Authority in February 27, 2014, and the National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) agreed to purchase electricity at a tariff of USD 0.14861/kWh.

It received its operating license in June 2019. Then, on July 8, 2019, Dito Telecommunity was granted a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity by the Government of the Philippines, authorizing it to begin building telecommunications infrastructure and offering telecommunications services nationwide.   In 2019, Dito Telecommunity — the third largest telecommunications service provider company in the Philippines — signed three loans worth $500 million with various branches of Bank of China for Phase 1 of a 4G/5G Telecommunications Network Project: a $100 million term loan facility with the Singapore Branch of Bank of China, a $200 million term loan facility with the Singapore Branch of Bank of China, and a $200 million term loan facility with the Hong Kong Branch of Bank of China. All of these loans carried maturities of one to two years and interest rate of three-month LIBOR plus a margin of 1.8-2.6 percent. All of the loans had fully disbursed by February 2020.

Ltd (CHEC) signed an EUR 67.2 million deferred payment (""延期付款”) agreement for the Marsa Shaikh Ibrahim Livestock Port Construction Project. The loan carried an 10-year maturity and the borrower (SPC) was expected to make monthly repayments with the retained (ring-fenced) portion of its monthly operating income. The other borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, is is known that SPC used the deferred payment arrangement to finance an EUR 70.24 million commercial (EPC+F) contract that it signed with China Harbour Engineering Co. Ltd.  The purpose of the project was to construct a 20,000-ton (DWT) livestock wharf berth, measuring 241 meters in length, in South Suakin (Sawakin) — known as the Marsa Sheikh Ibrahim (or Marsa Shaikh Ibrahim or Mersa El-Sheikh Ibrahim) livestock terminal — capable of export 7 million livestock per year. The project scope also included water works, dredging works, some civil engineering works and other supporting facilities. CHEC was the contractor responsible for implementation.  Phase 1 implementation commenced in 2011. However, due to SPC’s financial difficulties, construction was temporarily suspended. Construction restarted in May 2015. Phase 1 was officially completed on December 7, 2017. The Shaikh Ibrahim livestock terminal went into operation in 2019.   However, the deferred payment (lending) arrangement between SPC and CHEC appears to have underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of CHEC. Sudan’s Ministry of Finance initially set up a special bank account into which SPC deposited its monthly operating income (worth approximately $200 million a year), and SPC was allowed to retain some but not all of these funds for its own purposes (such as construction and maintenance of port facilities and servicing its debts to CHEC). However, Sudan’s Ministry of Finance subsequently took away SPC’s ability to retain a portion of its monthly income around 2011 (when the Sudanese Government faced an acute foreign exchange shortage), which made it substantially more difficult for SPC to honor its monthly repayment obligations. CHEC later disclosed that SPC was in arrears but continued to make interest payments.  Then, in July 2018, the parent company of CHEC (China Communications Construction Company, Ltd.) disclosed that a debt-to-equity swap would be undertaken to address the financial (repayment) difficulties of SPC. Under the terms of the debt-to-equity swap arrangement, a special purpose vehicle known as Sudanese & Chinese Marine Services, LLC (苏丹牲畜码头项目公司) would be established as a joint venture of SPC (51% equity stake) and CHEC (49% equity stake).

As of 2017, this project had achieved a 28% completion rate. However, AidData has not identified any evidence that it reached completion.   Implementation delays are likely related to the fact that the 280MW (4x70MW) Upper Yeywa Hydropower Plant was still not complete as of Q2 of 2021 and its construction has triggered various protests. Shan civil society groups have opposed the building of the Upper Yeywa Hydropower Plant. They claim that the project, which was started by the military regime in 2008, was initiated without local consultation or consent and that the reservoir of the 280 megawatt dam will stretch for 60 kilometers up to Hsipaw town, submerging centuries-old Shan communities and fertile farmlands. The dam site also lies in an active conflict zone, and Burma Army troops guarding the site have allegedly committed gross human rights violations against local villagers, including extrajudicial killing, torture and use of human shields.

88167,"China (People's Republic of)","Argentina","America",2017,2019,"Bank of China provides loan for TANGO FLNG Project (Linked with Project ID#88165)","On June 23, 2015, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China ltd (ICBC) and Exmar — a Belgian shipping company that specializes in liquefied gas logistics and storage — signed a $198 million export buyer’s credit agreement for the Caribbean Floating LNG (CFLNG) Project (captured via Project ID#88165). The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown.   The purpose of the project was to build and acquire the world's first floating LNG (FLNG) storage facility. The contractors responsible for the construction of this floating LNG storage facility were Wison (Nantong) Heavy Industry Co., Ltd. and Wison Offshore Engineering Co., Ltd. The FLNG ordered by EXMAR was to be the world’s first floating natural gas liquefaction unit. It was expected to have the functions of natural gas processing, liquefaction and storage, and represents the new generation of offshore units. The unit, which was 95% complete as of March 2015, was originally expected to serve as the gas project of Pacific Rubiales Energy, which is the second biggest oil and gas company of Colombia.  However, in March 2016, Exmar and Pacific Exploration & Production (PEP) agreed to terminate a 15-year tolling agreement (liquefaction and storage agreement) because PEP was facing a possible Chapter 11 filing (bankruptcy). Miguel de Potter, Exmar’s CFO, told a media outlet that the contract termination would limit his company’s exposure to a possible bankruptcy filing by PEP. 'Looking at the latest press releases, we have a fair chance to see that they will default on their [loan] covenant and will sometime end up in a Chapter 11 situation. By terminating the contract, we can open up the vessel to other opportunities,' Potter said. In March 2016, Exmar put out a press release, which said that '[s]ince the execution of the tolling agreement, the domestic natural gas market in Colombia and international LNG market have changed substantially making the liquefaction of LNG in Colombia no longer economic for PEP.' During 2016, the export buyer’s credit agreement with ICBC was also cancelled.  Then, on July 27, 2017, Exmar announced that it had taken delivery of the CFLNG from Wison Offshore & Marine in the People’s Republic of China. The CFLNG consists of a 500,000 tons per year floating liquefaction plant with 16,000 m3 of LNG storage and will remain moored in Wison Shipyard. Then, in August 2018, Exmar agreed to deploy CFLNG as a pilot production system for LNG export in Bahía Blanca, Argentina. A contract was signed by Exmar and the Argentinian Oil and Gas Company (YPF S.A.) on November 20, 2018 and the Caribbean FLNG became the Tango FLNG. Site specific modification and reactivation works were carried out in China, where the Tango FLNG unit was laid up. It was loaded onto a semi-submersible heavy lift vessel (HLV) close to Shanghai in December 2018. In parallel, gas treatment and compression equipment was sourced and procured, and modifications to the jetty were completed. The unit arrived in Bahía Blanca in February 2019. After mooring up, commissioning activities were started, ultimately resulting in the successful delivery of a first LNG cargo on June 6, 2019.  Shortly after the cancellation of the ICBC agreement, Exmar entered into negotiations with Bank of China (BoC). Following the signature of a term sheet in November 2016 with BoC and the approval of terms by the latter’s credit committees in December 2016 and January 2017, Exmar finalized the documentation required to enable parties to sign the credit agreement. The final credit agreement with BoC was subject to the approval of the credit insurer, Sinosure. Exmar originally expected this approval to be available by mid-April 2017. Ultimately, at the end of June 2017, EXPORT Lng Limited -- a 100% subsidiary of EXMAR NV -- signed a $200 million loan agreement with Bank of China (Boc) and Deutsche Bank for the financing of the TANGO FLNG (captured via Project ID#88167). This loan, which was insured by Sinosure, was fully disbursed (drawn down) as of July 27, 2017. The agreement with BoC provides a repayment period of 12 years and the loan bears interest at a rate of six-month LIBOR plus a 3% margin. The yearly estimated debt service amounts to $21.3 million. All obligations of the borrower are guaranteed by EXMAR NV (“guarantor”). There is a requirement for the owner to deposit an amount of $66 million in an escrow account (debt service reserve account).  On February 26, 2020, Bank of China released $40 million from the debt service reserve account. The relaxation of the cash collateral followed the steady operational results of the TANGO FLNG since September 2019, under the 10-years’ charter with YPF S.A. The $40 million was partially allocated to the repayment of the bridge loans and to cover Exmar's capital commitments. TANGO FLNG was performing 20% above its designed capacity in Argentina until May 2020. Since its arrival in 2019 at the Bahia Blanca terminal in Argentina up to May 2020, TANGO FLNG delivered five shipments or 624,000 m³ of LNG to its customer (YPF S.A.) with an availability of 99%.  However, the Argentinian Oil and Gas Company (YPF S.A.) invoked an alleged force majeure during the COVID-19 crisis, stopping all payments to Exmar. The dispute was referred to arbitration and ultimately YPF S.A. and Exmar came to a settlement whereby the 10-year contract for the TANGO FLNG was terminated. YPF S.A. is responsible for paying Exmar a cancellation fee worth $150 million payable over a period of 18 months, with payments secured. The balance of the settlement amount is payable by YPF S.A. in 13 monthly installments backed by a financial security issued by an investment grade counterparty.  Meanwhile, the TANGO FLNG unit has been demobilized from Argentina and stationed in a sheltered location in Uruguay. Since the effective termination of the contract with YPF S.A. in October 2020, marketing is in full swing and, given its status as a fully-proven facility, there is a healthy interest from the market for the redeployment of TANGO FLNG.

This RMB 300 million of grant funding was drawn down from an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) signed on December 1, 2015 by the Chinese Government and the Government of Zimbabwe, which committed RMB 400 million for several projects (see Project ID#72821). This grant commitment followed a pledge to finance the construction of the building that President Xi Jinping's made during his visit to Zimbabwe in 2015, as well as feasibility studies for the Parliament Building Construction Project that were carried out in 2015 by the Beijing Institute of Architectural Design Company Limited. The Chinese Government eventually increased the size of its grant commitment for the Parliament Building Construction Project to RMB 675,860,000.   The Parliament Building Construction Project involved the construction of a new parliament building (‘Parliament House’) that is located in the Hampden Hill area of Harare. The total construction area is 33,000 square meters, and the originally expected duration of project implementation was 32 months. The project, which comprises four floors on the Parliament side and an adjacent six-storey office building, encompasses a Chamber House, containing the 350-seat National Assembly and 100-seat Senate. A 108-seat gallery overlooks the National Assembly, while an 84-seat gallery overlooks the Senate. There are also 24 interpreters' rooms for both the National Assembly and the Senate; 12 for each House, which are linked to the state-of-the-art public address system.

The BCL carries the following terms: a 15 year maturity, a 3 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3.2% margin, a 1% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.5% ($514,245.88) management fee, and a 0.5% commitment fee.  The proceeds from the BCL will be used to finance 95% of the cost of a commercial contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC). The Government of Gabon was expected to cover the remaining 5% of the cost of the commercial contract.   The project involved the construction of a 22km road segment from Farasol-Mbéga to Port-Gentil. This road segment connects to the starting point of the China Eximbank-financed Port Gentil-Omboué (PO) Road (captured via Project ID#60747 and Project ID#73174).   CRBC was the contractor responsible for implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on February 28, 2016. The project was reportedly completed; however, its precise completion date is unknown.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the 22 km Farasol Mbéga-Port-Gentil Road Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  In mid-2014, a decline in international oil prices generated sharp reductions in Gabon’s oil exports and fiscal revenues. The country’s rising fiscal deficit led to the accumulation of arrears to external creditors. By 2017, the stock of the Government of Gabon’s external arrears stood at $115 million, including arrears to China, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Israel, and South Korea. All of these arrears were successfully cleared by 2020. However, the Government of Gabon accumulated $3 million of additional arrears to Chinese creditors in 2020.  By the end of May 2021, ‘the stock of [the Government of] Gabon’s external arrears stood at CFAF 98.03 billion (US$182.1 million), including CFAF 23.8 billion (US$44.2 million) vis-à-vis multilaterals and CFAF 21.05 billion (US$39.1 million) vis-à-vis government agencies and private creditors insured with companies from Paris Club member countries and from China [ICBC and China Construction Bank] CFAF 1.3 billion (US$2.42 million). The Government's strategy for the clearance of existing external arrears consists of focusing primarily on multilateral debt, bilateral debt, insured commercial commitments and seeking agreements with other creditors prior to the IMF Board meeting. Accordingly, we will clear the arrears vis-à-vis the multilaterals. We will also clear bilateral and commercial-insured arrears as follows: (i) Austria CFAF 6.83 billion (US$12.69 million); (ii) France CFAF 11.9 billion (US$22.11 million); (iii) Israel CFAF 2.23 billion (US$4.13 million); and Spain CFAF 0.09 billion (US$0.17 million). Regarding the other commercial arrears vis-à-cis AFREXIMBANK (CFAF 7.52 billion or US$13.97 million, and commercial non-insured vis-à-vis France CFAF 0.7 billion (US$1.24 million), Austria CFAF 8.71 billion (US$16.18 million), and Morocco CFAF 1.01 billion (US$1.87 million), we contacted these creditors individually to obtain from them the non-objection agreement. The same communication was made with China to which our bilateral payment arrears are about CFAF 34.01 billion (US$63.17 million).’ There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the Kpong Water Expansion Supply Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.

A proposal made by Dinesh Gunawardena, Minister of Water Supply and Drainage, to proceed with the relevant activities pertaining to the loan arrangements, was approved by Sri Lanka’s Cabinet in September 2014. Then, on August 21, 2017, China Development Bank and Sri Lanka’s National Water Supply & Drainage Board signed a $102.5 million loan agreement [ID#4510201701100001265] for the Thambuttegama Water Supply Project (WSP). This loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 15.5-year maturity and an all-in interest rate of approximately 2.954%. The loan’s final maturity date is March 6, 2033, and the Government of Sri Lanka issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. The borrower was to use the proceeds of the China Development Bank loan to partially finance a $120.5 million commercial contract between Sri Lanka’s National Water Supply and Drainage Board and China National Aero-Technology Import & Export Corporation (AVIC), which was signed in July 2015. The remaining $18 million was to be provided by the Bank of Ceylon, a state-owned commercial bank in Sri Lanka.   The purpose of the project is to provide safe drinking water via pipes to all 45 Grama Niladdhari divisions in Katana Divisional Secretariat covering 50% of the population in the area (similar to the CDB-financed Katana Water Supply Project captured via Project ID#53566).

In 2016, several credit rating agencies downgraded the Government of Mozambique to 'selective default' or 'restricted default' status, and the World Bank and the IMF re-classified Mozambique's external debt as 'in distress.' In January 2017, the Government of Mozambique defaulted on a coupon payment for its dollar-denominated Eurobond. Then, in February 2018, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that the Government of Mozambique had accumulated $710 million in arrears to external creditors and had agreed to reschedule some bilateral debt service payments with the Chinese Government. Two months later, in April 2018, Stelia Neta, a National Director at the Ministry of Finance of Mozambique revealed that the Government of Mozambique’s outstanding debt obligations to the Chinese Government amounted to $2.02 billion and the Chinese Government had agreed to extend the grace periods (and first principal repayments) on these outstanding debt obligations without changing their final maturity dates or interest rates (as captured via Project ID#66283).","Completion","Development","Loan","ODA-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese Private Sector",120349600.212937,"This project involved the upgrading and rehabilitation of an 288 km road (N6) from Beira to Machipanda and a bridge that was constructed over the River Pungue.

The Ethiopian House of Representatives ratified the loan under Proclamation No.988/2017 on December 27, 2016 and the proclamation went into effect on January 3. 2017. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 2.6% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 0.5% management fee, and a 0.5% commitment fee.  The borrower is expected to use the loan proceeds to finance approximately 50% of the total cost of a ETB 4,168,889,036.14 commercial (EPC) contract between Addis Ababa Roads Authority (AACRA) and China Communications Construction Company (CCCC). The remainder of the commercial contract cost is expected to be directly financed from the budget of City Administration of Addis Ababa.

The purpose of this project is support the construction of two subsidiary projects (‘Lot 1’ and ‘Lot 2’). Lot 1 involves the construction of the 11 km Qality-Tulu Dimtu Ring Road Interchange (also known as the Kality Ring Road Interchange - Tulu Dimtu Roundabout and the Qality Ring Road Interchange-Tulu Dimtu Ring Road), which is located on the outskirts of Addis Ababa. Lot 1 also involves the construction of five bridges as well as the Akaki Bridge. Lot 2 involves the construction of the 10.6 km Qality Ring Road to Qilinto Road (also known as the Kality Ring Road - Kilinto Roundabout and Bole Bulbula project and the Qality ring road to Qilinto road project). Lot 2 will connect Bole Michael ring road and Qality ring road and thereby provide for easy transportation route for the goods from the Qilinto industrial zone. This road segment is also expected to be useful for the condominium residents in the area. Lot 2 also involves the construction of a 250 meter-span bridge as well as an underpass bridge. Since both road segments (Lots 1 and 2) are located in areas that are important for trade, they are expected to improve market access for small businesses and industrial parks.

Then, on June 19, 2008, the parties signed a Memorandum of Understanding to amend the general loan agreement. On June 13, 2011,  pursuant to the terms and conditions outlined in the amended general loan agreement, China Eximbank signed a $99,908,163.60 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2011)23 TOTAL NO. (174)] with the Government of Mongolia’s Ministry of Finance for the Ulaanbaatar Housing and Infrastructure Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC (loan) were as follows: a 25-year maturity, a 9-year grace period, a 1.75% interest rate, and a 0% default (penalty) interest rate. The borrower was responsible for making 32 equal, semi-annual repayments (worth $3,122,130.12 each) after the expiration of the grace period. The borrower was expected to use the loan proceeds to finance 85% of the total cost ($117,539,016) of two commercial contracts between Beijing Construction Engineering Group Co., Ltd and Mongolia’s Ministry of Roads, Transportation, Construction and Urban Development: a commercial contract (BZA-2010/55-ISHC) signed on November 5, 2010 and a commercial contract (BZA-2010-Construction/172) signed on November 19, 2010. The loan achieved a 99.8% disbursement rate ($99,800,000 out of $99,908,163.60).   The purpose of the project was to reduce air and soil pollution in the city of Ulaanbaatar, construct 2,592 apartments in the 7th and 14th districts (VII and XIV districts) of Ulaanbaatar, install water, wastewater, power, and fiber optic utilities outside the apartments in the 7th district and the MNB district of Ulaanbaatar, and construct a 23.3 km power transmission line to deliver electricity to the 7th district and the MNB district. More specifically, this project supported the construction of 1800 apartments the in “Khangai Khothon” (“Хангай хотхон”) apartment complex within the 7th khoroo of Sukhbaatar district in Ulaanbaatar and the the construction of 792 apartments in the  “Tsagaan Khuaran Khothon” (“Цагаан хуаран хотхон”) apartment complex 14th khoroo of Bayanzurkh district in Ulaanbaatar.

SOMINA is the registered holder of the mining license for the Azelik Uranium Mine granted by the Government of Niger on November 8, 2007 for a period of 20 years covering a mining area of 220 square kilometers. On June 23, 2009, China Eximbank and SOMINA signed a $142,000,000 buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement for the Azelik Uranium Mine Project (captured via Project ID#91977). Under the terms of the BCL agreement, Somina was required to repay the loan in 11 installments, and pay interest on a quarterly basis. The loan was backed by a Sinosure credit insurance policy. It was also collateralized against equipment and vehicles owned by SOMINA and CNNC International Limited’s 37.2% equity stake in Somina. The outstanding principal of the GCL was approximately $90,880,000 on October 30, 2014, $78,100,000 on June 30, 2015, on $78,100,000 on August 19, 2015. Approximately three months earlier, on March 17, 2009, the Chinese Government and the Government of Niger signed a preferential loan framework agreement for the Azelik Uranium Mine Project. Then, in April 2011, China Eximbank and Société du Patrimoine des Mines du Niger (SOPAMIN) -- a Nigerian public holding company that manages the Government of Niger’s holdings in mining companies operating in the country — signed an RMB 650 million ($103 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Azelik Uranium Mine Project (captured via Project ID#256). The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate.   The proceeds of the loan were on-lent to SOMINA and used to finance the Government of Niger's 33% ownership stake in SOMINA.  The loan proceeds were also used by SOMINA to partially finance a $139.92 million commercial contract between Sinohydro Corporation Limited and China National Nuclear Corporation (CNCC), which was signed on March 31, 2008. Then, on August 24, 2009, SOMINA, as seller, and China Nuclear Energy Industry Corporation (中國原子能工業有限公司) (CNEIC),  as purchaser, entered into a Long-term Sales Contract. Under the terms of the Long-term Sales Contract, SOMINA agreed to sell and CNEIC agreed to purchase all uranium ore concentrates produced by SOMINA for a term ending on December 31, 2022. The purpose of the Azelik Uranium Mine Project was to develop the Teguidda mine at the Azelik uranium deposit. In addition to the development of the uranium mine, this project supported the construction of two coal-fired power plants and a hydrometallurgy plant.    China Nuclear International Uranium Corporation was responsible for the design of the project, and Sinohydro Corporation Limited was responsible for the implementation of the project. Trial operations of the mine began on December 10, 2010, with the first barrel of yellow cake uranium being produced on December 30, 2010. The mine officially started operations on March 17, 2011 and it reached a maximum capacity of 700 tons per year in 2012. However, mine production was suspended in mid-February 2015 due to cash flow problems. SOMINA reported at the time that its cash flow problems were the result of multiple factors, include the low and declining international price of uranium, delays in certain construction works related to the uranium mine, delays in the granting of a ‘favorable’ loan to SOMINA by the Government of Niger due to a military coup in Niger in 2010, and certain production process difficulties. In August 2015, SONIMA informed its shareholders that it extended a settlement with the local workforce for a temporary redundancy arrangement in compliance with the Niger labour law, until the end of August 2015. At that time, the mine was under temporary suspension and its production was expected to resume as soon as SOMINA’s cash flow position improved. However, as of 2021, mine production had still not resumed. SOMINA also faced criticism and pressure related to local protests over the lack of employment of local ethnic groups. low wages, and environmental degradation. This project also encountered a series of debt repayment problems.   On January 11, 2014, Focus International Development Corporation (FIDC) — a wholly-owned subsidiary of CNNC International Limited — and SOMINA signed a $4,500,000 bridge loan agreement with a 1-year maturity and an annual interest rate of 5.8% (captured via Project ID#91979).  As of the bridge loan’s final maturity date (December 31, 2014), the loan’s outstanding principal and interest were $4,343,257.88 and $182,856.78, respectively. Then, on January 2, 2015, FIDC and SOMINA signed a second bridge loan agreement worth $9,135,096.40 with a 2-year maturity and an annual interest rate of 7.8% (or the Hong Kong Dollar Best Lending Rate plus a 0.8% margin). The proceeds of the loan (captured via Project ID#91980) were to be used to refinance the accounts payable by SOMINA to CNNC (including the outstanding amount under the January 11, 2014 loan from FIDC), such that CNNC was not required to advance any new monies to SOMINA.    Also, in October 2014, SOMINA asked China Eximbank for an extension of the deadline for a $12,780,000 BCL (principal) repayment installment that was due on October 31, 2014 (and interest payment of approximately $444,000 for the third quarter of 2014). By February 2015, SOMINA met this repayment obligation. However, due to its tight cash flow position, SOMINA was not able to repay on time the next BCL (principal) repayment installment of $12,780,000 that was due on April 30, 2015. The borrower asked the lender for a repayment extension, and as of June 30, 2015, China Eximbank had not made any demands for immediate repayment of all outstanding debt or taken enforcement actions related to CNNC International Limited’s pledged 37.2% equity stake in SOMINA (which China Eximbank was entitled to do under the original terms of the June 23, 2009 loan agreement).","Completion","Commercial","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Joint Venture/Special Purpose Vehicle",123662289.392485,"This project supported the development of Teguidda mine at the Azelik uranium deposit.

The purpose of the project was to construct the infrastructure of the Great Stone Industrial Park (also known as the China-Belarus Industrial Park or Індустрыяльны парк «Вялікі камень» or Индустриальный парк «Великий камень»), which is located in the Smolevichi district between the Petrovichi reservoir and Minsk National Airport (25 km to the east of the capital city of Minsk). It involved the construction of 13 km of two-way, six lane roads inside the park; the installation of water supply, drainage, power supply, gas supply, communications systems; the construction of office buildings, warehouses, and factories; and the construction of a 110 kV transformer substation, six 10 kV distributions, 90 km power supply lines, one water supply plant, one rainwater treatment plant, one water intake station, and one secondary lift pump station. The park was designed to attract global high-tech enterprises with a focus on electronics, biomedicine, and engineering.    CAMCE — a subsidiary of Sinomach — was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by CJSC “Industrial Park Development Company”.  The construction of the park, which was modeled on the China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park, began on June 19, 2014. Then, on May 12, 2015, H.E. Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan inspected the project site in the company of H.E. Belarusian President Lukashenko. Construction, which was originally scheduled for completion in 2018, was completed on or around October 16, 2017.

The project consists of a 79 km long reservoir with a flood area of 3,800ha and an active capacity of 980 million cubic meters, and a 225 meter high earth-core rock-filled embankment dam with a volume of 20 million cubic meters. The dam will have a controlled spillway with a design flow of 22,600 cubic meters a second. The powerhouse will be underground with eight 300MW generating units, each driven by a headrace tunnel equipped with Francis turbines and vertical shaft synchronous generators. Water will be fed to the turbine chambers through eight tunnels. There will be two separate tunnels as well, for returning the water to the Cauca River. The hydraulic head of the power plant will be 197m. A 500kV main substation will be built outside the dam to transmit the power generated from the underground powerhouse. Upon completion, the Ituango hydropower plant will represent approximately 18 percent of the country’s total installed power capacity, and generate approximately 13,900 GWh of renewable electricity per year.  A consortium formed by the Camargo Correa (a Brazilian company), Colombians Conconcreto, and Coninsa is responsible for project implementation. Construction began in September 2011 and the project was originally scheduled to reach completion by the end of 2013. However, as of June 30, 2019, the project had achieved a physical progress rate of 72.7%. However, this project stalled in 2018 due to a geological event. To understand what happened, it is important to know how a dam is built. This process involves the construction of different tunnels to divert the water while raising the dam. As the project neared completion, EPM closed two of the three tunnels it had built. Then, on April 28, 2018 a landslide near the site blocked the remaining tunnel. With rain and new landslides, water rose to critical levels. That led EPM to what would be only one of a series of hard decisions: on May 10, 2018, the company flooded the dam’s turbine rooms to release the pressure being exerted on the structure by the river. Water levels were reduced, but all the equipment that had already been installed suffered irreversible damage. Two days later, one of the sealed tunnels ceded the pressure, unblocked and caused flash floods downstream. Over 113,000 people living downstream of the dam have already been evacuated, due to the risk of a collapse. Even today, the risk of new landslides from nearby mountains still remain, which could potentially compromise the integrity of the entire project. The attempt to save the dam includes the construction of a new project tunnel to reduce the levels of the flooded river, which would take several months. On December 12, 2018, IDB Invest granted EPM a waiver for its non-compliance with certain environmental covenants under the loan agreement caused by ‘the Ituango Contingency’. EPM and IDB Invest subsequently began negotiating an amendment to the loan agreement to revise the environmental covenants.","Implementation","Development","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Commercial Bank","Recipient State-owned Company",124798222.405371,"The purpose of the project is to build a 2,400 MW (2 GW) hydropower facility and dam over the Cauca River — the second largest river in the country — in the northern region of Antioquia.

The purpose of the project was to rehabilitate a 109 km segment of National Road No. 8 (NR 8) between Ksach Kandal and the country’s eastern border with the Vietnam Border. The starting point of this road is the Mekong River Bridge in Gala Province and the ending point is the eastern Cambodia-Vietnam border. The geographical distribution of National Road No. 8 is as follows: 45% in Kandal Province, 10% in Kampong Cham Province, and 45% in Prey Veng Province. The ultimate purpose of the project was to increase the well-being of the residents of Ksach Kandal, Kom Jai Mear, and Svay Ontour districts. They previously had to rely on the ferry or boats from Prek Tamak's port to travel to Phnom Penh and other places in the central and eastern parts of the country.  SCG was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. The project was supervised by Guangzhou Wanan Construction Supervision Company. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on March 15, 2007 and the originally anticipated duration of the construction period was 40 months.

Then, during Xi Jinping's September 2014 state visit to the Maldives, Xi suggested that the bridge would be called ‘the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge'. He also conveyed the Chinese Government’s interest in financing the construction of the bridge. On December 2, 2014, the Chinese and Maldivian governments signed an MOU for the project’s pre-feasibility study. Then, on July 9, 2015, the Chinese and Maldivian governments signed additional MoUs related to the project. The total cost of the project of the project was approximately RMB 1.26 billion ($222.4 million). It was financed with an RMB 724,500,000 ($126 million) grant from China’s Ministry of Commerce, an RMB 455,600,000 loan from China Eximbank, and 80,640,000 ($12.6 million) from the Maldivian state budget.   On July 14, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of the Maldives signed an RMB 455,600,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Sinamalé Bridge (China-Maldives Friendship Bridge) Construction Project. The GCL (captured via Project ID#38037), which went into effect on November 22, 2016, carried the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. MOFCOM separately issued a grant to the Government of the Maldives worth approximately RMB 724,500,000 (captured via Project ID#38082). The Government of the Maldives was expected to use the loan and grant proceeds to finance a $210 million commercial contract that it signed with CCCC Second Harbor Engineering Company Ltd. on November 23, 2015.  CCCC Second Harbor Engineering Company Ltd. was sanctioned in 2009 and barred from engaging in any road and bridge projects financed by the World Bank Group until January 2017.  China Eximbank made loan disbursements worth MVR 262,449,478 in 2016 and MVR 261,058,800 in 2017. The loan had achieved a 100% disbursement rate (RMB 455,600,000 out of RMB 455,600,000) and its amount outstanding was RMB 455,600,000 as of December 31, 2019.   The purpose of the project was to construct Sinamalé Bridge (‘the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge') in order to link the islands of Malé, Hulhulé and Hulhumalé (through Hulhulé') in the Maldives. The bridge also sought to connect the international airport to the capital city of Malé. The bridge is 2,000 meters long, of which 1,390 meters consists of a cross-sea bridge. It is 20 meters in width. The 760-meter long main bridge is a six-span steel tube-reinforced hybrid girder V-shaped rigid frame bridge. The whole bridge contains six deck closure sections, including three concrete girder deck closure sections and three steel box girder closure sections. The project required a total of 460 tons of 316L stainless steel plate embedded parts. The bridge 2 lanes for four-wheeled drives, 2 lanes for motorcycles, 1 lane for bicycles, and 1 lane for pedestrians.   CCCC Second Harbor Engineering Company Ltd. was the contractor responsible for project implementation. The project was originally scheduled to commence on December 25, 2015 and reach completion on August 30, 2018. Work on the bridge's foundation was original scheduled to commence on March 1, 2017, and work on the bridge's superstructure was originally scheduled to begin on April 23, 2017. Construction actually began on February 25, 2016 and the bridge was completed in July 2018. The bridge was officially inaugurated on August 30, 2018. It was then officially handed over to the Government of the Maldives on November 12, 2018. Sinamalé Bridge, which is the first inter-island bridge in the Maldives, has reportedly reduced commuting times significantly. Prior to the completion of the project, commuters had to endure rough seas and delays in ferry services. The project is considered an iconic landmark of the Belt and Road Initiative and the Maritime Silk Road.   In July 2020, the China Eximbank loan for the China-Maldives Friendship Bridge Construction Project was restructured through the G-20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI). Debt service payments were deferred until December 2020 and the outstanding balance of the loan was transferred to a new China Eximbank loan instrument along with the capitalization of accrued interest.","Completion","Development","Grant","ODA-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","Government Agency","Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Government Agency",128741043.039916,"The Sinamalé Bridge links the islands of Malé, Hulhulé and Hulhumalé (through Hulhulé') in the Maldives.

All subsidiary loans approved under the buyer’s credit facility agreement (captured via Project ID#45047) carried the following borrowing terms: a 13-year maturity and an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 2-3% margin. All of the subsidiary loans were secured with (i.e., collateralized against) Ethiopia's export receipts to China, which at the time primarily consisted of sesame seed export receipts. The buyer’s credit facility agreement also required that all Ethiopian exports (export receipts) to China to be overseen by the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, the country’s largest state-owned financial institution. 16 subsidiary loans for 16 different projects were reportedly approved under the buyer’s credit facility agreement. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), China Eximbank and the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE)— an Ethiopian state-owned bank — signed a subsidiary buyer’s credit loan worth approximately $125.205 million (ETB 1,082,214,356) for the 97MW Neshe Multipurpose Dam Construction Project on September 20, 2007.  The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $147.3 million (ETB 1.3 billon) commercial contract between the Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCo) — an Ethiopian state-owned enterprise — and China Gezhouba Group Corporation (CGGC), which was signed in December 2006. The $125.205 million (ETB 1,082,214,356) was provided in two tranches for two different lots (contracts). 53.7% of the face value of the loan ($71,742,465 or ETB 581,478,798) was earmarked for the Neshe Multipurpose Civil Work Contract (‘Lot 1’). 46.3% of the face value of the loan ($57,969,915 or ETB 500,735,558) was earmarked for the Neshe Multipurpose Electro Mechanical Work Contract (‘Lot 2’).

According to the Government of Ethiopia’s AMP, the ETB 500,735,558 loan ($57,969,915) for Lot 2 achieved a 104% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 8 loan disbursements (worth ETB 521,882,224) between 2009 and 2012: an ETB 24,803,050 disbursement on December 31, 2009, an ETB 24,229,515 disbursement on April 8, 2010, an ETB 159,702,521 disbursement on April 8, 2011, an ETB 187,753,061 disbursement on July 7, 2011, an ETB 39,950,859 disbursement on October 10,, 2011, an ETB 18,469,723 disbursement on January 8, 2012, an ETB 39,639,860 disbursement on April 8, 2012, and an ETB 27,333,635 disbursement on October 10, 2012. The purpose of the project was to construct the 97MW Fincha-Amerti-Neshi (FAN) hydroelectric power plant — also known as the Neshe multipurpose dam — on the Neshi River in the Blue Nile catchment within Eastern Wolega Zone in Oromia Regional State. Upon completion, it was envisaged that the multi-purpose dam would enable the irrigation of a 6,000 hectare plot nearby, where sugarcane is grown by the state-owned Fincha Sugar Factory (also known as the Finchaa Sugar Estate).   CGGC was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Dam construction started on July 22, 2010. The project was originally scheduled for completion on August 25, 2011. It was ultimately completed on November 17, 2011. A formal inauguration ceremony was held on December 17, 2011. Project implementation challenges and delays reportedly include a 24-month delay in the approval of the China Eximbank loan, power interruptions, and logistical problems while transporting construction materials from Djibouti port. According to field interview evidence collected by Detlef Müller-Mahn and Million Gebreyes, the implementation of the project also provoked two sets of concerns among local residents: ‘First, there is a general feeling of unfairness, because apparently information about the new project and its opportunities was not made generally available. Secondly, and worse than that, many people complain about broken promises and disappointed expectations, especially with regard to the payment of compensation and the organization of the out-grower scheme adjacent to the sugar cane plantation. Many respondents confirmed that compensation for land that was taken for the new dam was not paid as originally agreed, which, as they explain, was due to insufficient asset valuations, incorrect surveys, mismanagement, and corruption. Tensions in connection with the project were further aggravated when some of the resettled families realized that the new houses they had been given in the lowland area close to the sugar cane plantation were not as nice as they had expected and that living conditions in that location were not favorable. For that reason, many families left the new settlement again and went back to the highlands. They abandoned their new homes and the land they had been given. However, as out-growers they were no longer free in their decision about what to cultivate and where to live, but had to grow sugar cane for the factory. In 2017, when the farm managers of the sugar cane plantation realized that the land of the out-growers was no longer cultivated, they started to plant it with sugar cane. This again caused a major uproar among the settlers who claimed that the sugar company should pay rent to them. The company did so in the first year, but when it refused to do so in the second year, people threatened that they would burn the plantation and attack the factory. As a consequence, almost 2000 hectares of the out-grower scheme were left without cultivation.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient State-owned Company",129083662.014809,"The purpose of the project was to construct the 97MW Fincha-Amerti-Neshi (FAN) hydroelectric power plant — also known as the Neshe multipurpose dam — on the Neshi River in the Blue Nile catchment within Eastern Wolega Zone in Oromia Regional State.

Phase II of the Hambantota Port Development Project (HPDP) envisaged the construction of a large industrial area and a shipyard facility and required the acquisition of 1,500 hectares of land. It involved the construction of a quay wall (2140 m long) to accommodate 6 container berths, oil terminal (300 meters long), yard & roads, a flyover bridge, deepening of entrance channel (450 m wide, 840 m long, 18 meter deep), 2 feeder berths, construction of an artificial island (50 Ha) & handling facilities, and excavating a new basin area.   Upon completion, it was envisaged that the port in Hambantota, deeper than the one at Colombo, would be used as a refueling and docking station for the Sri Lankan Navy. CHEC was the general EPC contractor responsible for HPDP Phase II implementation. Phase II was formally launched on November 18, 2010. However, construction did not begin until September 16, 2012, a day before the three loan agreements were signed.  Phase II was originally slated for completion in November 2015. A formal port handover ceremony took place on December 11, 2017. However, as of December 31, 2017, Phase II had still only achieved a 96% physical completion rate.  Phases I and II of the Hambantota Port Development Project (HPDP) encountered financial management problems, debt repayment challenges, and corruption allegations. Hambantota Port generated lower-than-expected container traffic and proved to be commercially nonviable under SLPA ownership. Consequently, SLPA could not service its loans to China Eximbank. In response, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited (CMPort) — a subsidiary of China Merchants Group (a Chinese state-owned enterprise) — purchased a majority ownership stake in the port and the right to operate and develop it for 99 years.  More specifically, on July 29, 2017, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited (CMPort), a subsidiary of China Merchants Group, and Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA) signed a 99-year concession agreement and formed a joint venture to operate Hambantota Port. According to the terms of the joint venture agreement, CMPort acquired an 85% stake in Hambantota International Ports Group (HIPG) and a 49.3% stake in Hambantota International Port Services (HIPS), representing about 70% of the total equity. CMPort was also granted the operating and management rights of HIPG and HIPS as well as the lease and development rights of approximately 11.5 square kilometers of land in the Hambantota port area. CMPort agreed to make a total equity investment of $1.12 billion, of which $974 million would be used to acquire the 85% stake in HIPG and $146 million would be deposited into a bank account in the name of CMPort in Sri Lanka (for the expansion of Hambantota Port and shipping-related business).  According to a July 20, 2017 Cabinet Memorandum entitled ‘Hambantota Port Concession Agreement’ (No. MPS/SEC/2017/32) that was approved by Sri Lanka’s Cabinet on August 4, 2017, when the concession agreement was signed, responsibility for repayment of the China Eximbank loans that were contracted for the construction of Hambantota Port was transferred from SLPA to the General Treasury. Given that the General Treasury was also identified as the recipient of the $974 million cash infusion from CMPort, many media outlets and commentators reported that the arrangement represented a ‘debt-for-equity’ swap.  However, the Government of Sri Lanka continued to have difficulty servicing its debts to China Eximbank for Phases I and II of the HPDP after 2017. On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a ‘pre-emptive’ sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. This decision to suspend external debt service affected all of the China Eximbank loans that were issued for Phases I and II of the HPDP.  Another source of controversy arose in June 2018 when the New York Times reported that $7.6 million had been transferred from a Standard Chartered Bank account controlled by China Harbor Engineering Co. (labelled ‘HPDP Phase 2’) to affiliates of President Rajapaksa’s re-election campaign. The New York Times also reported that checks worth $1.2 million (linked to the ‘HPDP Phase 2’ bank account) were delivered to President Rajapaksa’s official residence.","Completion","Development","Loan","ODA-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company",130347756.667107,"On September 17, 2012, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Government of Sri Lanka signed three loan agreements for Phase II of the Hambantota Port Development Project.

The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. The Toromocho Project (特罗莫克矿山) is located in central Peru in the core of the Morococha mining district. It is one of the largest copper mines in the world, and the first greenfield copper mine developed by a Chinese corporation abroad. Upon completion, the project was expected to boost overall copper exports from Peru by 25%. CCCC Del Peru SAC (a subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company, Ltd.) was the contractor responsible for project implementation.   The Environmental Impact Assessment of the Toromocho Copper Mine Project was approved by the Peruvian government in December 2010. Chinalco Peru obtained the construction permit and began work in July 2011. The mines were officially commissioned on December 10, 2013. However, three months after its inauguration, the operation of the mine was suspended by Peru’s Environment Assessment and Enforcement Agency (OEFA) after it discovered the illegal discharge of acid effluents in two nearby lakes. Chinalco quickly resolved this matter by building improved drainage and explained the incident as a result of unusually heavy rainfall which caused unexpected acid runoffs.

Following the signing of the framework agreement, on March 2, 2004, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola. All borrowings under the MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility,  carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections. The process was managed by an office in the Angolan Ministry of Finance -- known as Gabinete de Apoio Técnico (GAT) -- that was specifically created to manage the MLFA with China Eximbank.  In October 2005, China Eximbank and the Government of Angola signed a $60,214,680.00 subsidiary buyer’s credit loan agreement under the MLFA for the Angolan Public Television (TPV) Center Construction and Equipping Project. The proceeds of the loan were used to partially finance a $66,905,200.00 commercial (EPC) contract with CEIEC, which was signed on March 9, 2005.  The purpose of this project, which employed 120 Angolan workers and 280 Chinese workers, was the construction and equipping of a production center at Televisao Publica de Angola (TPA) — an Angolan state-owned television station — in Camama within Kilamba-Kiaxi district and Luanda Province.  It involved the construction of an administrative building, two 400 square meters studio buildings, two 800 square meter studio buildings, a power supply building, a restaurant, etc.  These buildings are ring-shaped, with a small square with a water reflecting surface (mirror) in the middle, which is not only the center of all buildings, but also a place for social activities and certain ceremonies, and is a supplement to studio program production.

The loan that was issued for this project has encountered repayment problems. On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a ‘pre-emptive’ sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. Its decision to suspend external debt service reportedly affected all China Eximbank loans with amounts outstanding at the time of the announcement.   The purpose of the project was to facilitate the procurement of thirteen, Class S12 Diesel Multiple Units (DMUs) for Sri Lanka Railways, and thereby strengthen the passenger transport service of Sri Lanka Railways by adding 13 DMUs to its fleet of rolling stock. Seven of the S12 DMUs were ordered to strengthen long-distance travel on the Main Line from Colombo to Badulla. The steep slopes on the up-country portion of the Main Line make it difficult to operate. Prior to the S12 DMUs, only a few models of locomotives were capable of operating this line. Four of the S12 DMUs were ordered to serve the Kelani Valley Line. Two of the S12 DMUs were ordered to be used for tourist transportation. The thirteen S12 DMUs were scheduled for delivery in four batch by September 2012. CRRC Sifang — a wholly-owned subsidiary of China South Locomotive and Rolling Stock Industry (Group) Corporation — was the contractor responsible for delivery of the DMUs.  The first batch of DMUs arrived in Sri Lanka in August 2012. The first Main Line train using a S12 DMU began on October 23, 2012. This project is now complete, but the exact dates of delivery of the second, third, and fourth batches are unknown.

Amid a difficult market environment, the financing was well oversubscribed, underpinned by a well-developed commercial structure designed to ensure an acceptable risk-sharing mechanism between the project and the financiers. The ECA negotiation process began in January 2009 and commercial banks were invited to submit financing proposals in July/August 2009. The debt package consisted of US$4.6 billion in commercial tranches, US$5.7 billion of direct lending from ECAs and a US$3.8 billion loan from the sponsor, ExxonMobil.   The 17 banks that participated in the syndication of the commercial tranches were ANZ, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, BNP Paribas, Calyon, China Development Bank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Crédit Industriel et Commercial de Paris, DNB Bank ASA, Intesa Sanpaolo, Mizuho Corporate Bank, National Australia Bank, Natixis, Société Générale (SG), Standard Chartered Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, UniCredit and Westpac Banking Corporation. SG and Sullivan & Cromwell were appointed financial adviser and international legal adviser in early 2008.   The commercial tranches were divided into a US$1.95 billion uncovered term loan, US$800 million term loan guaranteed by Export-Import Bank of the US (US Eximbank), US$900 million guaranteed facility by the Italian ECA Servizi Assicurativi del Commercio Estero (SACE), and a US$950 million facility insured by Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI). China Development Bank contributed US$600 million (captured via Project ID#61186) to the US$1.95 billion uncovered term loan.

All facilities have a tenor of 17 years, except for the US$1.95 billion uncovered tranche, which has a maturity of 15 years. The interest rate is unknown.   On October 4, 2013, an additional syndicated loan facility of USD 1.5 billion was committed to fund the increased project construction cost. The debt consists of a USD$600 million term loan provided by a consortium of 10 banks, including $120 million USD from China Development Bank ((captured via Project#61187), and a USD $900 million sponsor loan from ExxonMobil. The loan has a maturity length of 13 years 6 months.   The purpose of the PNG Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project was to build gas production and processing facilities, onshore and offshore pipelines and liquefaction facilities in PNG with the capacity to produce 6.6 million tons of LNG per year.  The main components of the project include (1) an LNG plant (that consists of two LNG process trains, two 160,000 cubic meter LNG storage tanks, a marine loading terminal for LNG tankers up to 215,000 cubic meters, camp facilities, including accommodation and amenities, administration office, medical center, emergency helipad and sport and recreation center); (2) the Hides Gas Conditioning Plant (HGCP); and (3) a 700 km pipeline that transports natural gas from the Hides Gas Conditioning Plant to the LNG plant.   The LNG Plant is located 20 kilometers northwest of Port Moresby, at Caution Bay on the south coast of PNG’s Central Province. The LNG process involves removing impurities and cooling the gas down to a temperature cold enough to turn it into liquid form. Once achieved, the LNG is moved to specialized storage tanks. From there, the LNG goes through a pipeline connected to the jetty where it loads onto LNG carriers. These ships then export the LNG to the international market. The operation has the capacity to produce more than 8.3 million tonnes of LNG annually, an increase of 20 percent from the original design specification of 6.9 million tonnes per annum (MTA).   Condensate, a low-density mixture of hydrocarbon liquids recovered through the gas liquefaction process, is also stored and loaded onto tankers for export at the LNG Plant. The Hides Gas Conditioning Plant (HGCP) is located just outside of the township of Hides in PNG’s Hela Province. The plant processes up to 1 billion standard cubic feet of gas gathered from eight wells each day. At the plant, gas, condensate and water are separated and treated before being sent via separate pipelines to other facilities in PNG for further handling.The gas is transported along a 700-kilometre-long pipeline to the LNG Plant near Port Moresby where it is converted into liquid form, ready for shipping. Around 30,000 barrels of condensate is also produced at the Plant daily. After separation, the condensate is directed along its own pipeline to the Kutubu Central Processing Facility and later the Kumul terminal for export.   These production demands are met by more than 450 production staff who work around the clock every day of the year. Conditioned gas is transported from the Hides Gas Conditioning Plant (HGCP) in the Highlands to the LNG Plant just outside of Port Moresby via a state-of-the-art 700-kilometre-long pipeline. The pipeline includes an onshore and an offshore portion. The onshore section of pipe has a diameter between 32 and 34 inches and is buried one metre below ground. It travels a distance of 290 kilometers from the HGCP all the way down to the Omati River. The offshore section of pipe joins the onshore section at the Omati River and extends a further 407 kilometers to the LNG Plant. The offshore segment travels approximately 24 kilometers past Goaribari Island to the open sea, then across the Gulf of Papua to the Caution Bay landfall at the LNG Plant.   ExxonMobil PNG Limited, a subsidiary of ExxonMobil, is the is the entity responsible for operating the PNG Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project. In 2008, the initial PNG LNG Project partners signed a joint operating agreement. In that same year, an independent Economic Impact Study was commissioned and showed that the Project would have a significant impact on the GDP of Papua New Guinea, in addition to other benefits such as employment and business opportunities. Then, on Mary 22, 2008, the project venture participants and the the Government of Papua New Guinea formally signed the Gas Agreement, which established the fiscal regime and legal framework by which the PNG LNG Project is to be regulated throughout its lifetime and set the terms and mechanism for State equity participation in the Project. Following this, it was announced that the project would enter Front End Engineering and Design (FEED).   Between December 2009 and March 2010, sales and marketing agreements for the gas were signed with four major customers. An Environmental Impact Statement, which draws upon 26 supporting studies and took two years to complete, was approved by the PNG Government in October 2009. This documented the many rigorous commitments and measures the project would take to manage environmental risks.   On December 8, 2009 the project venture participants approved the project, paving the way for construction to begin. This was supported by the completion of financing arrangements with lenders in March 2010. Engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts were approved in late 2009 and in early 2010 construction work began. On or around April 29, 2014, the PNG LNG Project started production of liquefied natural gas ahead of schedule. Then, on May 25, 2014, the first shipment of liquefied natural gas from the PNG LNG Project was delivered by the Spirit of Hela to the Tokyo Electric Power Co. Inc. (TEPCO) in Japan. Chinese state-owned oil company, Sinopec, also signed an agreement (on December 3, 2019), with ExxonMobil to purchase 2 million tons of LNG annually from the PNG LNG project.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Other Private Sector",135364386.26278,"The purpose of the PNG Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project was to build gas production and processing facilities, onshore and offshore pipelines and liquefaction facilities in PNG with the capacity to produce 6.6 million tons of LNG per year.  The main components of the project include (1) an LNG plant (that consists of two LNG process trains, two 160,000 cubic metre LNG storage tanks, a marine loading terminal for LNG tankers up to 215,000 cubic meters, camp facilities, including accommodation and amenities, administration office, medical center, emergency helipad and sport and recreation center); (2) the Hides Gas Conditioning Plant (HGCP); and (3) a 700 km pipeline that transports natural gas from the Hides Gas Conditioning Plant to the LNG plant. The LNG Plant is located 20 kilometres northwest of Port Moresby, at Caution Bay on the south coast of PNG’s Central Province. The LNG process involves removing impurities and cooling the gas down to a temperature cold enough to turn it into liquid form. Once achieved, the LNG is moved to specialized storage tanks. From there, the LNG goes through a pipeline connected to the jetty where it loads onto LNG carriers. These ships then export the LNG to the international market. The operation has the capacity to produce more than 8.3 million tonnes of LNG annually, an increase of 20 percent from the original design specification of 6.9 million tonnes per annum (MTA). Condensate, a low-density mixture of hydrocarbon liquids recovered through the gas liquefaction process, is also stored and loaded onto tankers for export at the LNG Plant. The Hides Gas Conditioning Plant (HGCP) is located just outside of the township of Hides in PNG’s Hela Province. The plant processes up to 1 billion standard cubic feet of gas gathered from eight wells each day.

This run-of-river project is located in the Bhulbhule VDC of Lamjung district with the Gandaki Zone, which is 180 km away from Kathmandu. It involved the construction of the dam site, a 5 km tunnel, and a powerhouse. It also involved the installation of two turbines of 25 megawatts each and the construction of a 20 km, 132 KV single circuit transmission line from the powerhouse in Bhulbhule to Mid-Marsyangdi. On December 10, 2012, the signing ceremony was held for the strategic cooperation agreement between the Export-Import Bank of China and China Power Construction Corporation and the BOOT project financing agreement for the Shangmaxiangdi A Hydropower Station in Nepal. The total cost of the 50 MW Upper Marsyandgi Hydroelectric Power Plant Project was $165.9 million and it was financed according to a 70:30 debt-to-equity ratio. China Eximbank was the only lender for this project. Therefore, AidData assumes that the face value of the China Eximbank loan was $116.13 million.

The Government of Kenya, through various line ministries, supported the idea developed by Kenyatta University Management led by the then Vice-Chancellor, Prof Olive Mugenda. The idea came to fruition with the signing of an MoU on April 21, 2011, between the Chinese and Kenyan governments.   Then, on June 17, 2011, China Eximbank and the Government of Kenya’s National Treasury signed an RMB 744,560,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Kenyatta University Teaching Research & Referral Hospital Construction Project. The face value of the loan was subsequently revised to RMB 716,983,703.70. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20.75 year maturity, and a 7.25 year grace period. The loan was scheduled for semi-annual repayment installments beginning on September 21, 2018, and ending on March 21, 2032.    The National Treasury on-lent the proceeds of the GCL to Kenyatta University Teaching, Referral & Research Hospital (KUTRRH), which is a Kenyan state corporation. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the ultimate borrower to finance a commercial contract between the Government of Kenya and China Jiangxi Corporation for International Economic and Technical Co-operation (CJIC), which was signed on August 12, 2010.  The borrower made principal repayments worth RMB 27,576,296 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and RMB 55,152,592.00 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022).

The project involved the construction of Kenyatta University Teaching Research & Referral Hospital (肯雅塔大学教学转诊医院) in Nairobi. The hospital covers an area of more than 600 acres with a total construction area over 80,000 square meters, has a total of more than 650 beds, 8 high-grade operating rooms, 1 maternal center, 1 neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), 1 intensive care unit (ICU), 1 special intensive care unit (HDU), as well as medical imaging center, central supply room, oxygen, and medical gas system, boiler and laundry, medical waste treatment, funeral facilities, restaurant, teaching center, dormitory, and other supporting facilities. Construction of the 650-bed hospital involved the expansion and equipping of anatomy and basic science laboratories and the establishment of pre-clinical and clinical teaching departments at the university.    CJIC was the contractor responsible for implementation.  The project was originally scheduled to enter implementation in 2012 and reach completion by June 30, 2019. Construction commenced on November 1, 2012 and ended on December 14, 2016.   A formal project handover ceremony took place on May 24, 2019. However, the hospital did not open its doors to the first patient until October 28, 2019 after successfully conducting a ‘dry run’ from September 27, 2019 to October 27, 2019, followed by a successful 'soft run' from October 28, 2019 to November 24, 2019. To operationalize the first 160 beds, the hospital operationalized the oncology, renal dialysis, accident and emergency, trauma and orthopaedics, ICU, radiology, laboratory, pharmacy, mortuary, and other allied services. The hospital was designated as an isolation and treatment center on March 24, 2020 with over 400 beds designated for COVID-19 patients. A formal hospital opening ceremony took place on September 10, 2020. Then, in October 2021, an advanced cancer imaging center (known as the Integrated Molecular Imaging Centre Hospitality and Accommodation Centre) was launched at the hospital.   There are indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Kenyatta University Teaching Research & Referral Hospital Construction Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender and Kenya's National Treasury. As of October 17, 2018, 85% of the China Eximbank loan (worth 8,756,025,600 Kenyan shillings) had been disbursed and utilized. However, the remaining 15% of the loan (worth approximately 1.37 billion Kenyan shillings) had not yet disbursed in support of the personnel and capacity building component of the loan because disbursement was conditional upon the training of personnel (who were yet to be recruited by Kenyatta University due to ‘budgetary constraints’). KUTRRH was ultimately unable to meet its loan repayment obligations (due to the fact that it was generating insufficient revenue) and the National Treasury had to step in to ensure repayments to China Eximbank. Then, in December 2021, it was revealed by the Kenyan Government that KUTRRH was converted into an independent parastatal entity (and severed from Kenyatta University) on January 25, 2019 in order to use its future revenues to recover the funds needed to repay the China Eximbank loan.","Completion","Development","Loan","ODA-like","HEALTH","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company",136405917.317916,"This hospital is located on a 100-acre piece of land that lies along the Nairobi Northern Bypass road, in the Northwestern part of the Kenyatta University.

Then, in 2004, the Switzerland-based Colenco Power Engineering Ltd completed a project feasibility study.  On June 3, 2005, HPD and Yunnan Machinery and Equipment Import and Export Corporation (YMEC) signed an MOU regarding the 140MW Upper Paunglaung Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project. Then, on February 14, 2006, HPD and YMEC signed an $80 million commercial contract for the project. YMEC also reported provided a supplier credit to HPD to support the implementation of the project, and YMEC in turn financed the supplier credit by securing an export seller’s credit from China Eximbank.  The purpose of the project was to construct a 140MW hydroelectric power plant — with two, 70MW power generation units (Unit 1 and Unit 2) — on Paunglaung Creek. The project site is located 26 miles east of Pyinmana in Mandalay Division (exact locational coordinates:  19.756000, 96.598000) and 24 km upstream from the Paunglaung Dam (captured via Project ID#63813).   The project involved the construction of a 98 meter high RCC dam and a reservoir that stores 1,286 hm3 and extending 50 km. The reservoir was designed to allow the river to be regulated and thereby improve power generation at Lower Paung Laung and increase the irrigation potential further downstream. An above ground power plant is connected to the Lower Paung Laung switchyard via the Nancho hydropower plant by a 27 km long (to Nancho) 230 kV transmission line.   YMEC was the contractor responsible for implementation. Construction began in 2006 and a test run of the spillway was conducted in 2008. The rotor of Unit 1 was hoisted into place on December 2, 2013. The rotor of Unit 2 was hoisted into place on February 22, 2014. A project completion ceremony took place on December 9, 2015. The power plant connected to the national grid on or around December 24, 2015.    This project was plagued by controversy. One report from the civil society group Kayan Women’s Union alleged that the project supported involved forced labor and forced displacement. Another report from Physicians for Human Rights (PHR), Land in Our Hands, and Kayan New Generation Youth documented various human rights violations. The Myanmar Times found that more than 10,000 people from 23 villages were evicted after April 2013 to make place for the large dam. Among the affected groups were ethnic Kayan Lahta, Shan, Burman, and Pa-O. Most were moved to a relocation site near the Lein Li bridge, close to the middle of the reservoir. Residents were not well informed about the displacement process. They first learned about the project when officials came to place markers in their village to assess the water line for the reservoir, some villagers said. Many residents only realized that they would be displaced once construction work had started.  While the government assisted the relocation through the provision of new housing infrastructure and farmland, villagers and civil society groups were deeply concerned about related livelihood losses, provoked by the drowning of traditionally used farming, fishing and forest areas. The relocation sites were hilly and lacked enough fertile plain to offer sufficient land to everybody. Compensation procedures were reported as irregular, corrupt and not transparent. In several cases, the payments were insufficient to cover the costs imposed by the relocation on the villagers.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company",138172537.797455,"The purpose of the project was to construct a 140MW hydroelectric power plant — with two, 70MW power generation units (Unit 1 and Unit 2) — on Paunglaung Creek.

The loan officially went into effect on May 25, 2011. The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The ultimate borrower (EEPCO) was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance approximately 85% of the total cost of a $117,994,500 commercial (EPC) contract [No. 33.20/12/09] between EEPCO and Hydrochina-CGCOC JV, which was signed on November 28, 2009.  The Ethiopian Government directly funded the remaining 15% of the commercial contract cost (approximately $18,544,500).   According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $99,450,000 (ETB 1,646,523,179) loan (PBC) achieved a 97% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 7 loan disbursements (worth ETB 1,603,194,607) between 2011 and 2017: an ETB 298,469,388 disbursement on July 7, 2011, an ETB 682,737,266 disbursement on January 8, 2012, an ETB 266,957,500 disbursement on July 7, 2012, an ETB 74,386,618 disbursement on October 10, 2012, an ETB 101,657,404 disbursement on January 8, 2013, an ETB 178,986,403 disbursement on July 7, 2013,  and an ETB 27 disbursement on November 15, 2017. The purpose of the project was to install a 51MW wind farm — with a total of 34 towers each generating 1.5 MW — on a site located 95 km east of Addis Ababa, near the city of Adama in Oromia.   Hydrochina-CGCOC JV was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, consultancy services were provided by the Addis Ababa University Faculty of Technology, while a Chinese firm called Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co., Ltd. (or ‘Goldwind’) provided the wind turbines for the project. The EPC contract went into effect on November 12, 2009. The project was originally scheduled to commence on November 12, 2009, and reach completion on December 31, 2010. However, construction did not begin until June 2011. Then, an installation and hoisting ceremony for the project's wind turbines was held on April 21, 2012. Construction ended in June 2012. Then, the wind farm began commercial operations in August 2012.  According to the CGCOC, the wind farm began full operations in September 2012. An inauguration ceremony for the first phase of the Adama Wind Project was held on December 1, 2012.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Adama I Wind Farm Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension).

The shared purpose of these two projects — the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport Expansion Project and the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport Terminal 1, VIP Terminal, Associated Works Design and Build Project — was to increase the annual passenger handling capacity of Addis Ababa Bole International Airport from the 7 million to 22 million. These two projects involved the expansion of an existing terminal (Terminal 1) with a floor area of 30,000 square meters for domestic and regional trips, the construction of a new terminal (Terminal 2) with a floor area of 74,000 square meters for international trips, and the construction of a VIP terminal. Upon completion, Terminal 2 was expected to have three floors—arrival, departure and ground floors — and include boarding areas, lounges, recreation centers, shopping malls, offices, parking, and other facilities. The VIP terminal — designed for use by leaders, senior government officials, diplomats and other dignitaries — was expected to includes various saloons, lounges, conference rooms, recreation centers, duty-free shops, an IT center and an exclusive parking lot.   Addis Ababa Bole International Airport is located in the Bole area of the city of Addis Ababa, 6 km (3.7 mi) southeast of the city center and 65 km (40 mi) north of Debre Zeyit. Its coordinates are 08°58′40″N 38°47′58″E.  CCCC was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by EAE. The French construction firm ADP Ingénierie supervised construction activities, while the design of the project was managed by CPG Corporation Pte. Ltd., a Singaporean company. Shanxi Construction investment Group Co. Ltd was also involved in the project (most likely as a subcontractor).   The purpose of the $225 million EPC contract between CCCC and EAE was to construct Terminal 2 (‘Phase 1’). The purpose of the $138 million EPC contract between CCCC and EAE was to construct the VIP terminal and expand Terminal 1 (‘Phase 2’).  Phase 1 construction activities began in June 2014. By December 11, 2016, Phase 1 had achieved a 40% completion rate. Phase 1 was originally expected to reach completion by January 2018 (in time for the 30th Ordinary Summit of the African Union). However, it was ultimately completed and officially inaugurated on January 27, 2019. The inauguration ceremony was attended by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. Phase 2 implementation activities commenced in September 2017 and were still underway four years later. On March 30, 2021, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed visited the new VIP terminal being built at the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport. Phase 2 was originally scheduled for completion on May 15, 2021.

The loan included the following borrowing terms: a maturity of 20 years (final maturity date: September 21, 2029), a grace period of 5 years (first repayment date: March 21, 2015), an interest rate of 2%, a default (penalty) interest rate of 0%, a management fee of 1%, and a commitment fee of 0.75%. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance a commercial contract [number SCG-CLL 001] between Shanghai Construction (Group) General Company and Malawi's Ministry of Transport, Public Works, and Housing, which was signed on December 19, 2008.   The loan's principal amount outstanding was RMB 336,000,000 as of June 2023. As of 2022, the borrower expected to make principal repayments each year worth RMB 42,000,000 until 2029.  The project supported the construction of the Bingu International Conference Centre, Presidential Hotel, and Presidential Villas in the capital city of Lilongwe. Construction activities included a 130-room business hotel, a 1,000-seat dining hall and 170,000-square meter presidential villas.  Shanghai Construction (Group) General Company, which is also known as Shanghai Construction Group, was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by the Malawi Ministry of Transport, Public Works & Housing. The groundbreaking ceremony took place on December 12, 2009.

There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Malawi International Conference Centre and Business Hotel Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2021, Malawi's Minister of Finance announced that ‘in 2020/21 FY, Government [of Malawi] requested temporary debt service suspension from bilateral creditors. This is in line with the Extended Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI). The key feature of the Extended DSSI is that the repayment period of the principal and interest payments falling due between 1st January 2021 to 30th June 2021 will be made in five years with one-year grace period. This entails that in 2021/22 FY, the suspended debt service will be within the grace period.’ Then, in November 2022, the World Bank and the IMF judged the Government of Malawi’s external debt and overall public debt to be ‘in distress’—a downgrade from the previous World Bank-IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA). In July 2023 correspondence with AidData’s Executive Director, the Government of Malawi revealed that it was in negotiations with China Eximbank about rescheduling all of their loans with amounts outstanding. The Government of Malawi proposed principal payments worth RMB 61 million and interest payments worth RMB 26 million in 2023, interest payments worth RMB 26 million and principal payment deferrals in 2024 and 2025, RMB 50 million in principal and interest payments in 2026, RMB 90 million in principal and interest payments in 2027, RMB 89 million in principal and interest payments in 2028, RMB 88 million in principal and interest payments in 2029, RMB 87 million in principal and interest payments in 2030, RMB 86 million in principal and interest payments in 2031, and RMB 85 million in principal and interest payments in 2032.

Then, in November 2009, China Eximbank and the Government of Papua New Guinea signed a $95 million preferential loan framework agreement for Phase 1 of the Pacific Marine Industrial Zone (PMIZ) Project. On September 29, 2010, China Eximbank and the Government of Papua New Guinea (represented by its Ministry of Treasury and Finance) signed an RMB 678,571,429 ($95 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for Phase 1 of the Pacific Marine Industrial Zone (PMIZ) Project. The GCL reportedly carried the following terms: 20-year maturity. 5-year grace period, 2% interest rate. The proceeds of the GCL were to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract with CSYIC.   The purpose of the project was to construct a Pacific Marine Industrial Zone (PMIZ) in Portions 1349 and 1350 of Vidar Plantation within Madang Province. The project involved the construction of a fish port (with a cannery/tuna processing plant) and refrigeration plant), a fuel farm, a container terminal, a power plant, water and wastewater facilities, and an export processing zone. Upon completion, the project was expected to encourage onshore processing of tuna resources and create economies of scale, which would reduce post harvest losses through the construction of an integrated modern port complex.   The Department of Commerce and Industry of the Government of Papua New Guinea claimed at the time that the country was losing $808 million a year because it did not process fish caught in its waters. At the design/appraisal stage, an economic evaluation of the project suggested that it would achieve an economic internal rate of return (EIRR) about the Government of Papua New Guinea’s 12% hurdle rate.   CSYIC was the contractor responsible for implementation. Project implementation was delayed for years due to legal, land ownership, and environmental issues and China Eximbank reportedly withheld disbursements until some of these issues were resolved. The project officially entered implementation on November 24, 2015. However, in 2017, the project scope was expanded to include a larger wharf and cover the costs of water, electricity, and telecommunication connections. PNG's Prime Minister Peter O'Neill announced in September 2017 that China Eximbank would fund the expanded project with a $150 million dollar loan. The project ultimately completed and handed over to the local authorities on January 31, 2019.   The project was plagued by controversy for three reasons. First, an audit of the Department of Commerce and Industry revealed that government officials had siphoned off ‘millions of kina’ from the PMIZ project through graft and corruption. Second, government officials ignored independent recommendations to site the project in Port Moresby or Lae, where firms could utilize existing infrastructure to operate at lower production costs. The International Finance Corporation declined to finance for the PMIZ when the Department of Commerce and Industry refused a project feasibility assessment and indicated that it would only consider locating the PMIZ in Madang Province (which infrastructure, transport, labour and communications networks). Third, Madang residents mobilized land claims to demand a greater share of benefits from tuna-based investments. Hundreds of coastal residents staged large protests and defaced PMIZ billboards – consistent with predictions of a ‘high potential of sabotage from those that will be detrimentally affected by the PMIZ’ included in the PMIZ feasibility study contracted by China Eximbank.   In May 2015, individuals living within the impact area of the PMIZ, apparently under the guidance of Ken Fairweather (a Member of Parliament for Sumkar), circulated a petition “Stop PMIZ – a ‘Fishy Deal’"". They demanded a response by May 25, 2015. The petition was presented to the Governor of Madang. Ken Fairweather assisted the villagers by presenting it on the floor of Parliament. This brought a reaction from Nixon Duban, the member for Madang proper, who objected in Parliament, ‘Our people have registered their umbrella companies, they are all organized, and I want to assure the Government that we want this project to go ahead.’   Within a week Duban had the support of Madang Governor, Jim Kas. The Prime Minister, Peter O’Neill, had already put out a press release, which said that ‘The Government is fully supportive of the PMIZ project continuing. There has been some misinformation, particularly in relation to land ownership, and this is unfortunate. The land where the PMIZ project is located was bought from RD Tuna Cannery for four million Kina and is State land, not customary land as some have claimed. . . . We are satisfied that the project will not cause pollution to the environment, especially the pristine water ways and islands of Madang. . . . In total the project will generate K2 billion every year in economic activity to our nation with most of this being around Madang Province. Through this project, the processing of tuna will be done in Papua New Guinea instead of being sent overseas. The PMIZ will generate more than 20,000 jobs for local communities through direct employment and the generation of small business. . . .

The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of a $142.28 million commercial contact between Zambia's Road Development Agency and China Harbour Engineering Limited, Ltd (CHEC), which was signed in July 2016. As of July 2022, the loan from China Eximbank had achieved a 10.1% disbursement rate ($13,219,206.11 out of $129,734,105.49).    The purpose of the project is to upgrade a 122 km stretch of the D019 road between Kawambwa to Mporokoso from gravel to the bituminous standard. CHEC is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 27, 2017. However, virtually no progress was made during 2018, with a project completion rate of 2%. Consequently, the project’s intended completion date was pushed back until July 23, 2021. According the Zambian Road Development Agency's 2020 Work Plan, construction is ongoing, but a March 9, 2020 media report says the project experienced further delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic.   This project has also been plagued by allegations of corruption. In June 2019, Christopher Siwakwi, an investigations officer from Zambia’s Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), told the Lusaka Magistrates’ Court that foreign currency (USD) moved from a CHEC bank account to purchase two properties allegedly owned by Zambian Infrastructure and Housing Minister Ronald Chitotela. Siwakwi, however, testified that the properties — lot number 148 of farm 50A and subdivision A of lot 22183 /M  Ibex Hill — were established to be in the names of the previous owners, Mary Lubinga and Former Labour Minister Austin Liato.  Ronald Chitotela, Gregory Chibanga and Brut Holdings were charged with two counts of concealing the two properties while Diris Mukange was charged with two counts of possession of the same properties, which are suspected to be proceeds of crime. They all pled not guilty. During the trial before principal resident magistrate David Simusamba, Christopher Siwakwi said his investigations established that the contract for the sale of the properties was in the name of Diris Mukange (as a buyer for both properties), while the negotiations for the prices were done by Ronald Chitotela and his wife when he was Deputy Minister for Sports and Youth Development. Siwakwi said the price of the property in Makeni was K1.6 million while the Ibex Hill one was purchased at K1.8 million, adding that the source of income to buy the same was tracked back to CHEC. Siwakwi recounted how ACC in June 2017 received a complaint that Ronald Chitotela was in possession of property suspected to have been proceeds of crime and had received a bribe from CHEC. Siwakwi said ACC also received additional information that the money used to purchase the properties originated from CHEC. Siwakwi said the ACC team embarked on investigations to establish whether the allegations were founded. Siwakwi said he visited the Bank of China where he established that China Harbour had a U.S. dollar account with the bank which transferred $300,000 to Andrews and Partners on July 27, 2016 at its FNB bank account which was payment for legal services and attached to the bank statement was a contract for the upgrading of Kawambwa-Mporokoso road.

This announcement came approximately 21 months after the Government of Zambia defaulted on its repayment obligations to Eurobond holders and approximately 6 weeks after China, France, and 14 other countries formed a creditor committee to discuss the Zambian authorities’ request for a debt treatment under ‘the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the DSSI’ endorsed by the G20 and the Paris Club.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Government Agency",141390682.159542,"The purpose of the project is to upgrade a 122 km stretch of the D019 road between Kawambwa to Mporokoso from gravel to the bituminous standard. https://www.openstreetmap.org/directions?engine=fossgis_osrm_car&route=-9.7920%2C29.0770%3B-9.3706%2C30.1219#map=12/-9.7805/29.2492","Low income","Precise","Yes"

TEL also executed a Power Purchase Agreement, Water Use Agreement and Coal Supply Agreement on July 27, 2017, October 17, 2017 and May 13, 2017, respectively. Then, on March 15, 2018, Hub Power Company (Hubco) signed a shareholders’ agreement with Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited (FFC) and China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC). Under the terms of this agreement, Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited (FFC) and China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) Tel Power Investments Limited purchased 30% and 10% equity stakes, respectively, in TEL from HUBCO.   The total cost of Phase 1 of the 330 MW Thar Block 2 (TEL 1) Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project, which is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative and the Belt and Road Initiative, was $520 million. It was implemented as an Independent Power Project (IPP) and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25.  On December 20, 2018, TEL — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture between HUBCO (60% ownership stake), FFC (30% ownership stake), and CMEC Tel Power Investments Limited (10% ownership stake) — signed two loan agreements worth $390 million for Phase 1 of the 330 MW Thar Block 2 (TEL 1) Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project: a $260 million syndicated loan facility agreement with CDB and China Minsheng Bank Corporation Limited (CMBC) and a PKR-denominated syndicated loan facility (worth $130 million) with HBL, Bank Alfalah Limited, Bank Al-Habib Limited, National Bank of Pakistan, Soneri Bank Limited, Faysal Bank Limited, and Sindh Bank Limited. The remaining project cost ($130 million) was provided by the project sponsors via equity infusions. The estimated borrowing terms of the syndicated loan from CDB and CMBC are as follows: a 10 year maturity, a 3 year grace period, a 5.8% interest rate, and a 5% Sinosure insurance premium. The Government of Pakistan issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. Sinosure also provided credit insurance (95% political risk coverage and 65% commercial risk coverage). The estimated cost of the Sinosure credit insurance policy is 7% of the borrower’s total debt service to CDB and CMBC. Additionally, as a source of security (collateral) for the syndicated loan from CDB and CMBC, the owners of TEL pledged their shares (equity stakes) in the project company. The proceeds of the loan were used to finance at least two commercial contracts: a $262.5 million commercial contract with CMEC (with a 32 month work period) that was signed on May 26, 2018 and a commercial contract (with an unspecified monetary value) with Hebei Engineering Company that was signed on on December 14, 2018.    The purpose of Phase 1 was to construct a 330MW mine-mouth coal-fired power plant in Thar Block II, near the villages of Singharo-Bitra in Taluka Islamkot within the district of Tharparkar in Sindh Province. The power plant was to be fueled by a coal mine also in Thar Block II operated by Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC). The coal mine has 3.8 million tons per annum capacity. China Machinery and Engineering Corporation (CMEC) — a subsidiary of Sinomach and 10% stakeholder in TEL — was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Project implementation commenced in 2018, but the precise start date is unknown. The power station entered partial commercial operations in July 2019, and the coal mine is currently in the operational test phase. As of October 2021, Phase 1 was nearing completion.

(“Nevsun”). Under the terms of the agreement, ENAMCO agreed to purchase a 30% ownership stake in the Bisha Mining Share Company (BMSC) from Nevsun Resources Ltd., which with the Government of Eritrea’s 10% free carried interest brought ENAMCO’s total ownership stake in BMSC to 40%. Then, in November 2007, China Eximbank issued an $80 million commercial loan to the Government of Eritrea for Phase 1 of Bisha Gold Mine Project.   The proceeds of this loan were use to partially fund ENAMCO’s acquisition of a 30% ownership interest in the Bisha Gold Mine. Then, on July 12, 2010, China Eximbank issued a $60 million follow-on loan to the Government of Eritrea for Phase 2 of the Bisha Gold Mine Project. The loan agreement for Phase 2 was signed by China Eximbank President Li Ruogu and the Eritrean Minister of Finance Berhane Abrehe It is unknown how the proceeds of this loan were used. The China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 is captured in Project ID#56386 and the China Eximbank loan for Phase 2 is captured in Project ID#73371.   Construction of the mine began in September 2008 and was completed by 2010. The mine began the commercial production of gold in February 22, 2011, which allowed for an early payback of gold phase capital and allowed for complete funding of both the copper and zinc phase expansions. Then, the mine transitioned from gold production to copper production in late H2 2013 and commenced commercial production of copper in December 2013 and commercial production of zinc in October 2016 following the completion of the zinc expansion project. Then, on August 31, 2018, China Construction Bank Corporation (“CCBC”) issued a binding commitment letter in which it agreed to fully underwrite a $870,000,000 (approximately C$1.1 billion) loan to Gold Mountains (H.K.) International Mining Company Limited — a wholly-owned subsidiary of Zijin Mining — to facilitate the acquisition of a 55% ownership stake in Nevsun Resources Ltd. (captured via Project ID#89500).   This loan carried a 5-year maturity and an interest rate of LIBOR plus an unknown margin.

72502,"China (People's Republic of)","Jordan","Middle East",2017,NA,"China Eximbank contributes $150 million to syndicated buyer’s credit loan for 554MW Attarat Oil Shale Fired Power Plant Project (Linked to Project ID#64457, ID#72499, ID#72500, and ID#52552)","In October 2014, Jordan’s National Electric Power Company (NEPCO) signed a 30-year power purchase agreement with a consortium led by Eesti Energia (Enefit) — an Estonian utility company that operates most of the world’s installed oil shale generation capacity — to build an oil shale-fired power plant in Attarat (Attarat um Ghudran), a town located 100 km southeast of Amman. The exact locational coordinates of the power plant are 31°16′08″N 36°26′52″E. It was envisaged that the plant would utilize Jordan’s vast reserves of oil shale and help reduce the country’s reliance upon imports of oil products for power generation. Upon completion, this plant was expected to consume around 10 million tons of oil shale per year and generate 470 megawatts of baseload power by 2021. The plant would reportedly generate enough power to meet 10-15% of Jordan's electricity needs (about 3.7 billion kWh). NEPCO would act as the plant’s sole offtaker. The total cost of this project was $2.11 billion and it was implemented as an independent power project (IPP) and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25.   On March 16, 2017, a consortium of four Chinese state-owned banks signed a $1.582 billion syndicated loan agreement with Attarat Power Company (APCO) — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and project company that is owned by YTL Power International Bhd of Malaysia (45% ownership stake), Guangdong Yudean Group Co. Ltd of China (45% ownership stake), and Eesti Energia AS (Enefit) of Estonia (10% ownerships stake) — for the 554MW Attarat Oil Shale Fired Power Plant Project. The syndicated buyer’s credit loan reportedly consisted of a $594 million contribution from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (captured in Project ID#52552), a $594 million contribution from Bank of China (captured in Project ID#72499), a $244 million contribution from China Construction Bank (captured in Project ID#72500), and a $150 million contribution from China Eximbank (captured in Project ID#72502). The borrowing terms were as follows: a 15 year maturity and an annual interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (1.426% in March 2017) plus a 3% margin. Sinosure provided buyer’s credit insurance to the the borrower. An extensive security package was also provided to the lenders that covers all of the infrastructure and materials required to operate the plant, including over the valuable land concession from the Government of Jordan.   The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract that APCO signed with Guangdong Power Engineering Corporation (GPEC) — a subsidiary of China Energy Engineering Corporation — on October 31, 2014. Under the terms of this EPC contract, GPEC agreed to undertake, on a turnkey basis, the design, engineering, procurement, construction, erection, interconnection, commissioning, start-up, testing, completion, placing in operation and delivery of the oil shale fired electric generation plant. Foster Wheeler was responsible for the provision of the circulating fluidized bed boilers. Siemens was responsible for the provision of steam turbine generators. Worley Parsons was responsible or the design of the power plant. In addition to the debt financing that was used to support this project, the shareholders in APCO agreed to provide ‘base shareholder funding’ (i.e. equity investments) of up to $528 million. These equity contributions were announced on March 16, 2017 after Enefit of Estonia and Near East Investment sold a 15% equity stake in APCO to YTL Power International Bhd and a 45% equity stake in APCO to Guangdong Yudean Group Co. Ltd (see Project ID#64457). Guangdong Yudean Group Co. Ltd is a Chinese state-owned utility that is jointly owned by Guangdong Province (76% equity stake) and China Huaneng Group (24% equity stake).   As of 2017, the 554MW Attarat Oil Shale Fired Power Plant Project was the largest private sector investment and example of limited recourse financing in Jordan’s history. Upon completion, it was expected to have 554MW of gross power generation capacity and 477MW of net power generation capacity. It was expected to consist of two circulating-fluidized-bed units and draw oil shale from a nearby open cast mine. It was expected to employ 5,500 individuals (including 2,000 Chinese nationals) during the construction phase and 1,000 individuals each year after the construction phase is completed. On March 16, 2017, APCO issued a ‘notice to proceed’ to the EPC contractor (GPEC). Then, on March 20, 2017, construction began. Project implementation was suspended for two months during the spring of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, construction resumed in May 2020.   The project is ultimately expected to deliver power generation capacity in two phases: 235MW in 2020 and 235MW in 2021. APCO has entered into a 30-year agreement with NEPCO for the sale of the plant’s entire power generation capacity following its construction. The 2 x 235 MW Attarat oil shale-fired power plant project is expected to deliver capacity in two phases, 235 MW in 2H 2020 and 235 MW in 1H 2021. Unit 1 of the 2 x 235 MW Attarat oil shale-fired power plant, which also includes an open-cast mine, was synchronized with Jordan’s national grid on May 26, 2021. As of the same date, the entire project had achieved a 96% completion rate. However, the 554MW Attarat Oil Shale Fired Power Plant Project has become a source of local controversy. To facilitate repayment of the loan (and provide a financial return to its equity holder), APCO entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with National Electric Power Corporation (NEPCO), the Jordanian state-owned power utility. NEPCO agreed to serve as the sole offtaker (i.e., single buyer) and purchase all power generated by the oil shale-fired power plant in Attarat at a price of approximately $0.17 per kilowatt hour (kWh). However, NEPCO signed several other PPAs with private companies around the same time, which resulted in too much power generation capacity and not enough customers.   As of late 2021, many of APCO’s competitors were selling electricity at $0.10 per kilowatt hour (kWh), which put NEPCO between a rock and a hard place: it is contractually obligated to purchase power from APCOM at $0.17 per kWh without enough customers to whom it can resell the power.  On December 19, 2020, NEPCO and the Government of Jordan (GOJ) initiated international arbitration proceedings against APCO with respect to the PPA and the GOJ guarantee of NEPCO’s payment obligations. NEPCO and the GOJ sought declaratory judgments that (a) the $0.17 per kWh tariff is ‘grossly unfair’ and (b) NEPCO can terminate the PPA if its ‘gross unfairness’ is not addressed. APCO has insisted that its loan agreement with ICBC, China Eximbank, Bank of China, and China Construction Bank was based on an internal rate of return (IRR) calculation of 17% (which in turn is based on the $0.17 per kWh tariff) and that it won’t be able to repay its debts if the IRR and tariff rate are downwardly revised.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Other Private Sector|Other Private Sector|Chinese State-owned Company|Other Private Sector",144042269.627621,"This project involves the construction of an oil shale-fired power plant in Attarat (Attarat um Ghudran), a town located 100 km southeast of Amman.

It also involved the construction of: a new raw water intake to serve both the Djiri 1 and Djiri 2 water treatment plants; two raw water flow distribution structures, a ductile iron pipe (540 ml DN 1200) for the delivery of the total raw water flow for the Djiri 1 and Djiri 2 water treatment plants from the raw water pumping station to the primary distributor; a ductile iron pipe DN 700 for transferring the flow for Djiri 1 from the primary distributor to the secondary distributor; a water treatment system; a treated water tank with a capacity of 4,000 m3 (two compartments of 2,000 m3 each); a treated water pumping station with a capacity of 5,250 m3 / h, power 1,180 kW (i.e. 1,475 kVA), a common reagent building for the two water plants of Djiri 1 and Djiri 2 (the existing reagents building of Djiri 1 being converted into a reagent storage building for Djiri 1 and Djiri 2); two lime water saturators; a chlorine building housing the calcium hypochlorite dosing equipment for the two water plants and an electro chlorination station; a transformer station for the treated water pumping station equipped with two 6300 kVA transformers (including one emergency); a transformer station for filter washing equipment and process equipment, equipped with two 1000 kVA transformers (including one emergency); an electrical substation and an electricity distribution system; a control and supervision system; a television surveillance system; approximately 500 meter of fiber optic cable; a sanitation network; outdoor facilities; on-site accommodations for the staff of the Control Mission and the Administration; and fifteen new housing units (110 m 2 to 170 m 2 ) for operating staff.    The Djiri Water Treatment Distribution Network Project involved efforts to strengthen the treated water distribution network (“le renforcement du réseau de distribution d’eau traitée.”) in the capital city of Brazzaville. More specifically, it involved the rehabilitation of a 10,000 m³ reservoir and a 4,000 m³ water tower; the construction of seven reservoirs (6,000 m 3 , 5,000 m³, 3,500 m³, 3,000 m³, 2,250 m³, 1,250 m³, 300 m³); the construction of four recovery stations (80,000 m3 / d, 3 + 1 pumps 500 kW, 1 + 1 transformers 2,000 kVA; 8,200 m3 / d, 2 + 1 pumps 200 kW, 1 + 1 transformers 630 kVA; 6,800 m3 / d, 2 + 1 pumps 110 kW, 1 + 1 transformers 400 kVA; 1,800 m3 / d, 2 + 1 pumps 30 kW, 1 + 1 transformers 160 kVA); the installation of power supply for recovery stations (laying approximately 2.3 km of 20 kV underground lines); the laying 183,000 ml of pipes for the primary network, including 61,000 ml of ductile iron DN 1000 to DN 500 and 122,000 ml of PVC pipes DN 400 to DN 200; and the installation of a remote management system between the sites of the recovery stations and reservoirs and the supervision room of the Djiri water treatment plants (for the transmission of data on water levels, flow rates).    The Djiri Water Treatment Plant Extension Project involved the rehabilitation (modernization) of a water treatment plant called ‘Djiri 1’ — that was originally built in 1983 and is co-located with the Djiri 2 water treatment plant north of the capital city of Brazzaville — with treated water production capacity of 2,250 m3 per hour [“la réhabilitation de l’usine d’eau existante de Djiri d’une capacité de deux mille deux cents cinquante (2.250) m3 par heure”]. More specifically, it involved civil engineering rehabilitation works (settling tanks, filters, treated water tank, treated water pumping station, annex buildings); the replacement of all existing equipment; and the rehabilitation of the 16 existing accommodations for operating staff.    China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) was the contractor responsible for the implementation of all three projects.

The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. The Government of Maldives issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $150 million 'EPC plus financing' (EPCF or EPC+F) turnkey contract between Maldives Sun Group (an alternative name for Ahmed Siyam Holdings Pvt Ltd) and China Communications Construction Company Limited, which was signed on January 30, 2016. The scope of the turnkey contract included the design and construction of the Irufen Island Resort.   By the end of September 2018, the loan had achieved a disbursement rate of 32.9% (with $42,061,601 of $127.5 million being disbursed). China Eximbank made loan disbursements to Ahmed Siyam Holdings Pvt Ltd worth $20,715,590 during calendar year 2020.  The loan’s amount outstanding was $106,784,411 as of December 31, 2019, $121,125,000 as of December 31, 2020, and $125,055,695 as of December 31, 2021.  Ahmed Siyam Holdings Pvt Ltd made loan repayments to China Eximbank worth $6,375,000 during calendar year 2020 and no loan repayments to China Eximbank during calendar year 2021.   The purpose of the project was to design and construct the Irufen Island Resort (also known as Sun Siyam Iru Fen Maldives) on the Noonu Atoll, which covers an area of 54 hectares. The resort was originally planned to feature beach villas, showstopper suites, private pools, restaurants, bars, a world-class spa, wellness and sports facilities, a kids’ village. Its location is close to some of the best dive spots in the region. Upon completion, the resort was expected to become the largest in the Maldives with 509 rooms. The Financial Times called it 'the biggest resort development deal in Maldivian history.' The resort owner of Ahmed Siyam Holdings Pvt Ltd -- also known as the Maldives Sun Group or Sun Siyam -- is Ahmed Siyam Mohamed, who was the leader of a political party in the ruling coalition of the then-President Abdulla Yameen, and one of the biggest tycoons in the country’s lucrative tourism sector.   CCCC Highway Consultants Co., Ltd. (中交公路规划设计院有限公司) was responsible for project design and China Communications Construction Co., Ltd. (CCCC) was responsible for project implementation. Construction commenced in December 2019. After implementation delays due to COVID-19, the resort opened its doors to guests on October 28, 2021. The project was originally expected to reach completion in June 2020. It reportedly employed 64 Chinese workers and 1,193 foreign workers.   The China Eximbank loan that was issued in support of this project has been a subject of local controversy. Due to the fact that the Government of the Maldives issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan, the private debt contracted by Ahmed Siyam Holdings Pvt Ltd threatened to become a public debt in the event that the Irufen Island Resort Project was insufficiently profitable of the borrower defaulted on its repayment obligations. Due to economic difficulties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, this risk became more obvious in 2020. Ahmed Siyam Holdings Pvt Ltd failed to meet a $10 million loan repayment obligation that was due to China Eximbank on July 21, 2020. The next day, China Eximbank warned the Government of the Maldives that, as the ultimate guarantor of the private debt, it was responsible for the loan repayment obligations of Ahmed Siyam Holdings Pvt Ltd., and failing to meet these obligations would result in a sovereign default, thereby jeopardizing the country’s international credit ratings and its macroeconomic stability. This issue was ultimately resolved when the Maldivian government threatened to exercise its mortgage rights if Ahmed Siyam Holdings Pvt Ltd did not deposit the overdue payment in an escrow account within five business days. Then, in 2021, the borrower made no loan repayments to China Eximbank (despite the fact that the loan's grace period had expired).","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRADE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Private Sector",146923115.020174,"The purpose of this project is provide a loan to finance the Irufen Island Resort.

This loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. In 2013, the Government of Gabon and China Eximbank also signed a USD-denominated preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the Port Gentil-Omboué Road and Ogooué River Booué Bridge Construction Project.  The face value of the PBC was approximately 254.4 billion CFA francs, or approximately $534,582,600. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. The proceeds from the GCL and the PBC were used to finance a $663 million EPC contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC). Approximately 95% of the cost of this project was financed by China Eximbank while the remaining 5% was financed by the Government of Gabon itself.  The GCL that supported this project is captured in Project ID#60747. The PBC that supported this project is captured in Project ID#73174.   The project involved the construction of a 93.26 km two-way, two-lane highway from Port Gentil to Omboué (with an asphalt concrete surface, a subgrade width of 12 meters, and a subgrade width of 10 meters), the construction of three bridges (the 4707 meter Ogooué River Bridge, the 367 meter Booué Bridge, and the 4577 meter Nkomi Laguna Bridge) measuring 13 km in length, and the construction of 141 culverts.   CRBC was the contractor responsible for project implementation. It received an order to commence construction on March 20, 2014. Then, a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 3, 2014. The project was handed over on December 23, 2020.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loans for the Port Gentil-Omboue Road and Bridge Construction Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  In mid-2014, a decline in international oil prices generated sharp reductions in Gabon’s oil exports and fiscal revenues. The country’s rising fiscal deficit led to the accumulation of arrears to external creditors. By 2017, the stock of the Government of Gabon’s external arrears stood at $115 million, including arrears to China, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Israel, and South Korea. All of these arrears were successfully cleared by 2020. However, the Government of Gabon accumulated $3 million of additional arrears to Chinese creditors in 2020.  By the end of May 2021, ‘the stock of [the Government of] Gabon’s external arrears stood at CFAF 98.03 billion (US$182.1 million), including CFAF 23.8 billion (US$44.2 million) vis-à-vis multilaterals and CFAF 21.05 billion (US$39.1 million) vis-à-vis government agencies and private creditors insured with companies from Paris Club member countries and from China [ICBC and China Construction Bank] CFAF 1.3 billion (US$2.42 million). The Government's strategy for the clearance of existing external arrears consists of focusing primarily on multilateral debt, bilateral debt, insured commercial commitments and seeking agreements with other creditors prior to the IMF Board meeting. Accordingly, we will clear the arrears vis-à-vis the multilaterals.

The proceeds from the PBC were to be used by the borrower to partially finance an EPC contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), which was signed on September 24, 2004.   On November 5, 2005, China Eximbank provided an additional $68.9 million to the Government of Indonesia for the Surabaya-Madura Island Bridge Construction Project through an amendment to the PBC agreement that became effective on September 13, 2005.

Then, on September 15, 2017, the Sierra Leone Ports Authority, the National Commission for Privatization of the Republic of Sierra Leone, the Government of the Republic of Sierra Leone, Sky Rock Management Limited, and National Port Development (SL) Ltd. signed a concession agreement in connection with the Upgrade and Expansion of the Queen Elizabeth II Port in Freetown. The agreement granted National Port Development (SL) Ltd. (塞拉利昂共和国国家港口发展有限公) — a project company and special purpose vehicle (SPV) — the right to expand, upgrade, and operate Queen Elizabeth II Port for 25 years.  On November 29, 2017, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of (ICBC) and the Export-Import Bank of China signed a $659 million syndicated facility (loan) agreement with National Port Development (SL) Ltd. for the Port Elizabeth II Upgrading and Expansion Project. Of the total $659 million (captured via Umbrella Project ID#62222), China Eximbank contributed $130 million (captured via Project ID#62224) and ICBC contributed $529 million (captured via Project ID#62223). The syndicated loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus 350 basis points, a 2% default (penalty) interest rate, and a commitment fee of 0.5%. The loan is secured by (i.e. collateralized against) project revenues/port development levy fees deposited in a lender-controlled bank account, the proceeds from the borrower’s Sinosure credit insurance policy, Sky Rock Management Ltd.’s equity stake (shares) in the project company [National Port Development (SL) Ltd.], project machinery and equipment, and all movable assets (tangible or intangible) of the concessionaire in connection with the ‘New Port’ (as defined in the concession agreement and AidData’s ‘Staff Comments’). Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development issued a sovereign guarantee for the loan, and the borrower was required to use part of the loan proceeds to purchase a credit insurance policy from China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure), which insures 95% of the facility plus accrued interest against political and commercial risk.  The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower, National Port Development (SL) Ltd., to finance a $708,295,101 commercial contract that it signed with a consortium of Chinese companies -- consisting of Tidfore Heavy Equipment Group Co., Ltd. (泰富重装集), China Integrity International Oceaneering, Co., Ltd., Tidfore (Tianjin) Oceaneering Equipment Co., Ltd., and Tianjin Jinhao International Trade Co., Ltd.-- which was signed on March 8, 2017 and amended on November 29, 2017. In order to facilitate loan repayment, Tidfore will collect a ‘development levy fee,’ which will be charged over and above the usual port handling charges. This fee is expected to generate $950 million over a 16 year period. Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development has reportedly flagged that this fee could raise the cost using the port to such a high level that shippers will avoid using it, thereby leading to an overall loss of revenue and threatening the borrower’s ability to repay the loan (thus raising concerns about the Government of Sierra Leone’s contingent liability).  The purpose of the Port Elizabeth II Upgrading Project is to renovate the facilities at Queen Elizabeth II Quay in Freetown, which is operated by Sierra Leone Ports Authority. It involves the design and construction of four new terminals and yards for the quay. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on November 29, 2017, and construction began in December 2017.  This project has become a source of local controversy and scrutiny. In 2018, the implementation of the project was reportedly halted (at least temporarily) after reports emerged that the legal entity responsible for the project—National Port Development (SL) Ltd.—was owned by Israeli businessman who had generously contributed to the President of Sierra Leone’s reelection campaign during the previous year. The IMF also sounded the alarm after learning that Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance issued a sovereign guarantee in support of a syndicated loan, which placed an extraordinarily large contingent liability (worth 15% of the country’s GDP) on the government’s books.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Other Joint Venture/Special Purpose Vehicle|Recipient Government Agency|Recipient Government Agency|Other Miscellaneous Agency Type|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company",149803960.412726,"The Queen Elizabeth II Quay is located in the capital city of Freetown.

However, it is known that the borrower was expected to use the proceeds from the PBC to finance 85% of a $150 million commercial contract between Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company (LWSC) and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) Zambia Limited, which was signed in January 2013. The Government of Zambia agreed to directly finance the remaining 15% ($22.5 million) of the commercial contract cost.   The project involved the construction of a new raw water abstraction station on the Kafue River, a water treatment plant, a 66 km treated water pipeline from Kafue to Lusaka, and a booster station in Chilanga and transmission lines to deliver a total of 50,000m3/day of water into the existing Stuart Park storage facilities in Lusaka. The ultimate objective of the project was to improve water supply to Lusaka and surrounding areas. Upon completion, the project was expected to benefit 480,000 people in Lusaka and surrounding areas.   China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) Zambia Limited was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company (LWSC). A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 20, 2016. However, construction did not begin until September 5, 2016. It was originally anticipated that the project would be completed by November 2018. However, this did not occur due to delays in the delivery of water distribution pipelines. The scope of the project was also revised during implementation to include additional works involving the construction of the Iolanda intake structure (at the Iolanda water treatment plant) and the installation of the Chilanga Booster Pump to meet the power requirements of the project. On September 17, 2020, the President of Zambia visited the project site and affirmed the construction quality and progress of the project. As of December 2020, the project had achieved a 96% completion rate. On July 29, 2022, a project completion ceremony took place. At the ceremony, Zambian president Hakainde Hichilema said that the completion of the project would ensure that about 500,000 people in the Zambian capital have access to clean and safe water as well as proper sanitation. Eric Ding, the general manager of the CCECC Zambia, thanked the Zambian government and the local people for their support during the construction period. He, however, said more financing will be required to undertake the second phase of the project to increase the water supply to the Zambian capital due to the increased population which requires more water. 1,000 local residents were reportedly employed and trained at the peak of the construction phase of the project.  China Eximbank and Zambia’s Ministry of Water Development, Sanitation, and Environmental Protection also signed a $79,982,494.00 term loan facility agreement for the Kafue Bulk Water Supply Power Substations Project circa 2019 (see linked ProjectID #98552). The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. The purpose of the project is to construct electricity substations (transformers) and additional works to support the newly constructed facilities at the Kafue Bulk Water Supply Project. The electricity substations were originally scheduled for installation by February 2020.

The borrowing terms of this loan were as follows: an interest rate of 6 month LIBOR plus a 2.35% margin, a 3 year grace period, and a 12 year maturity. The Ethiopian Government provided a sovereign guarantee for this loan.  On June 1, 2011, China Development Bank (CDB) and the ESC also signed a $150,000,000 (ETB 2,533,783,784) loan agreement for the Kessem Sugar Factory Project (captured via Project ID#58592). The Ethiopian Government also provided a sovereign guarantee for this loan. The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: an interest rate of 6 month LIBOR plus a 2.35% margin, a 3 year grace period, and a 12 year maturity.   The borrower was initially expected to use the CDB and China Eximbank loan proceeds to finance a commercial contract between the ESC and the Ethiopian state-owned Metals & Engineering Corporation (MetEC), which was signed in March 2011. However, in 2012, the Government of Ethiopia dismissed MetEC and re-issued the commercial contract to China National Complete Plant Import-Export Corporation (COMPLANT).   According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the ETB 2,077,702,703 loan (captured via Project ID#30113) achieved a 43.8% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making a single disbursement of ETB 911,906,704 on July 7, 2013.   According to the Government of Ethiopia’s AMP, the ETB 2,533,783,784 loan (captured via Project ID#58592) achieved a 110% disbursement rate, with CDB making 6 loan disbursements (worth ETB 2,283,941,874) between 2012 and 2014: an ETB 387,188,627 disbursement on June 29, 2012, an ETB 261,859,928 disbursement on October 18, 2012, an ETB 215,748,901 disbursement on January 11, 2013, an ETB 417,546,480 disbursement on June 6, 2013, an ETB 484,171,322 disbursement on June 18, 2013, and an ETB 517,426,615 disbursement on April 30, 2014.  The purpose of the project was to construct the Kessem sugar factory, which is located in Zone Three of the Awash Fentallie and Dulecha districts of Afar Regional State. The factory has a total of 20,000 hectares of land to be cultivated with cane & its plantation stretches to the areas known as Kessem and Bolhomon. The Kessem Dam, which has a capacity of holding 500 cubic meters water, is the source from which sugarcane cultivation was to be carried out.    COMPLANT was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began in May 2012 and ended on November 30, 2014. Irrigable land reached 2,946 hectares while the construction of 20.5 kilometers of main canal was completed. Then, in March 2015, the factory underwent a trial run. Factory operations began in 2016. However, according to the AMP, the project had only achieved a 99.05% completion rate as of April 2022.   Currently, the sugar factory has 8,413 hectares of land covered with cane among which 6,000 hectares cultivated by a private company known as Amibara Agricultural Development (with which ESC has signed contractual agreement). Kessem Sugar Factory is capable of producing 260,000 tons of sugar and 30,000 cube meters of ethanol per year at maximum capacity.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank and CDBs loan for the Kessem Sugar Factory Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lenders. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs.

The Government of Gabon holds a 28.9% ownership stake in Comilog. The loan carries a 11.5 year maturity period, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR + a 4.3% margin (0.478% + 4.3% = 4.778%). ICBC provided 70% of the financing ($109.9 million) while BNP Paribas provide the remaining 30% ($47.1 million). BNP Paribas acted as the mandated lead arranger, facility agent and security agent.   The first loan disbursement was scheduled for April 2011, and loan repayments were scheduled over 16 equal and consecutive semi-annual installments (which implies a 3.5 year grace period). The loan was insured by Sinosure. The Government of Gabon also issued a sovereign guarantee for 25% of the face value of the loan on July 14, 2011. This project involved the construction of the Moanda Metallurgical Complex (CCM) near the town of Moanda within Haut-Ogooué Province in south-east Gabon.

In exchange for hiring CNEEC, the Government of Zambia requested that China Eximbank extend a preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) for both projects and that CNEEC arrange the financing. In 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Zambia signed a $183.23 million PBC agreement for the 86MW Lusiwasi Lower Hydropower Expansion Project and the 15MW Lunzua Hydropower Rehabilitation Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. According to a 2014 report from Zambia’s Office of the Auditor General (source ID#67159), the proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance (a) 85% ($139,353,132) of the cost of a commercial contract ($163,944,861.43) between ZESCO Limited and CNEEC for the 86MW Lusiwasi Lower Hydropower Expansion Project, which was signed on July 21, 2011; and (b)  85% ($44.2 million) of the cost of a commercial contract ($52 million) between ZESCO Limited and CNEEC for the 14.8MW Lunzua Hydropower Rehabilitation Project, which was signed on July 21, 2011. The remaining 15% was to be provided by the Government of Zambia in counterpart financing.   The 86MW Lusiwasi Lower Hydropower Expansion Project involves the upgrading of the Lusiwasi Hydroelectric Power Plant, which is located in Serenje District and Central Province (exact locational coordinates: -13.34642,31.01898), from from 12MW to 86MW. The project was originally scheduled to reach completion on September 7, 2014.  However, it has faced major implementation delays and become a source of local controversy. One source of concern that emerged was overpricing and the fact that the CNEEC was selected as the contractor through a sole-source contract rather than through a competitive bidding process. Additionally, a Government of Zambia inquiry into CNEEC’s background revealed that the company did not perform to the required standards of good workmanship and quality delivery on previous contracts. ZESCO Limited eventually notified CNEEC of its intentions to terminate their commercial contract. Then, in October 2011, Government of Zambia made the decision to terminate the commercial contract with CNEEC. However, CNEEC was not willing to refund an advance payment of $32,334,632.75 that ZESCO Limited provided between December 21, 2010 and August 23, 2011. Upon consultation between the Government of Zambia and ZESCO Limited, it was decided that the commercial contract would be reinstated in order to avoid the additional costs that would arise from termination. More specifically, a ""no-objection"" was granted as per China Eximbank's request. Upon reinstating CNEEC in June 2012, ZESCO Limited agreed with CNEEC that the implementation would start with the 14.8MW Lunzua Hydropower Rehabilitation Project, and upon completion of that project, the contractor would proceed to implement the 86MW Lusiwasi Lower Hydropower Expansion Project. As of 2017, the 86MW Lusiwasi Lower Hydropower Expansion Project had only achieved a 48% completion rate (against a target rate of 90%).

92518,"China (People's Republic of)","Namibia","Africa",2014,2014,"ICBC provides $140 million loan to CNNC to facilitate its acquisition of 25% ownership stake in Langer Heinrich uranium mining operation in Namibia","On January 18, 2014, Australia's Paladin Energy Ltd. signed an agreement to sell a 25% joint-venture equity stake in Langer Heinrich Mauritius Holdings Ltd. (its flagship Langer Heinrich uranium mining operation in Namibia) to CNNC Overseas Uranium Holding Limited — a wholly owned subsidiary of China Uranium Corporation Limited—  for $190 million. The offtake component of the agreement allowed CNNC to purchase its pro-rata share of product at the prevailing market spot price. There was also an opportunity for Paladin to benefit by securing additional long term offtake arrangements with CNNC, at arm's length market rates, from Paladin's share of Langer Heinrich production. Then, on July 15, 2014, China National Nuclear Corporation and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) signed a $140 million acquisition loan to complete the payment of the equity consideration for the merger and acquisition. The merger and acquisition was successfully completed on July 23, 2014.   On March 23, 2017, Paladin Energy Ltd. said that it decided to take its Chinese joint venture partner (CNNC) in the Langer Heinrich uranium project in Namibia to arbitration. CNNC had previous notified Paladin Energy Ltd. that it was seeking to determine the fair value of the Paladin Energy Ltd.’s 75% ownership stake in Langer Heinrich Mauritius Holdings Ltd., which would be the first step in a process that could lead to the exercise of the potential CNNC option. If exercised, Paladin Energy Ltd. stood to lose its stake in the mine to CNNC. However, Paladin disputed this option, saying it was only applicable in the event of default, which had not occurred. Meanwhile, Paladin Energy Ltd. sought to extend existing standstill agreements with creditors, to buy time to pursue the arbitration proceedings. At the time, the company had in place standstill agreements with bondholders representing 75% of its 2017 and 87% of its 2020 convertible bonds.   Then, on May 25, 2018, Paladin Energy Ltd announced that the Langer Heinrich Mine was to be placed on care and maintenance and stopped presenting ore to the plant because of persistently low uranium prices. In its annual report for the year ended June 30, 2019, Paladin Energy Ltd announced that in February 2019 it had completed a concept study that identified multiple options to reduce operating costs, improve process plant performance and potentially recover a saleable vanadium product. Such annual report also disclosed that in March 2019 it commenced a two-stage pre-feasibility study respecting a potential re-start of mining operations at the Langer Heinrich Mine upon a sustained recovery in uranium prices, with the first stage expected to be completed in September 2019 and examining a rapid, low-risk restart of the mine and the second stage expected to be completed in March 2020 and involving a more detailed study, including process optimization aimed at lowering costs, recovering vanadium and potentially increasing production in the later stages of the mine life. In the report, Paladin also disclosed that a re-start would be considered only if forecast cash flows from uranium sales provide an appropriate return on investment.   On October 14, 2019, Paladin Energy Ltd announced the completion of the first stage of its pre-feasibility study, which included a JORC compliant mineral resource estimate for the Langer Heinrich Mine with measured resources of 71.87 mmlb of U3O8 (66.2 million tonnes at an average grade of 0.049% U3O8) and indicated resources of 17.96 mmlb of U3O8 (18.8 million tonnes at an average grade of 0.044% U3O8). Such resource estimate was reported on a depleted basis to June 30, 2018 and did not include stockpiles. Paladin's disclosure regarding the prefeasibility study included: (a) an estimate of $80 million required for the rapid restart of the mine, including $38 million for plant repair and improvement and $42 million for working capital; (b) an initial production capacity of 5.2 mmlb, while processing high and medium grade ores for approximately an 8-year period (after a 12-month ramp-up), followed by production capacity of 2.7 mmlb while processing low grade ores for approximately 12 years; and (c) a resulting average life of mine all-in sustaining cost of approximately $33 per pound, consisting of life-of-asset mining costs of $8.40 per pound, processing costs of $18.20 per pound, other operating costs of $2.60 per pound and capital costs of $3.80 per pound. Paladin further disclosed that it had identified opportunities, requiring estimated discretionary capital expenditures of $30 million, to significantly debottleneck existing mining and mineral processing operations to 6.5 mmlb per year and reduce all-in sustaining costs by approximately $4.50 per pound.   On June 30, 2020 Paladin Energy Ltd announced the result of the Langer Heinrich Restart Plan, which refined the results of the previous Prefeasibility Report. The Restart Plan is based on a re-sequencing of mining and processing activities outlined in the 2019 PFS and takes elements from both the PFS 5.2Mlb Option and the PFS 6.5Mlb Option.

The originally expected completion date of the project was November 30, 2019. However, the project has been plagued by delays and controversy and it was still not complete as of mid-2020. Its planned end date was eventually pushed back to December 2020.   Bangladeshi environmentalists and human rights advocates filed a set of complaints related to the project, alleging that the city Capital City Development Authority (RAJUK) violated a host of environmental regulations and laws by adding the exhibit hall as part of a set of changes to the township’s overall design. The High Court and the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, in separate orders, declared the Bangladesh-China Friendship Exhibition Center illegal. In March 2014, the Supreme Court issued a decision instructing RAJUK ‘not to efface, subtract, vary, modify or otherwise change the core forest, forest, lakes or canals, urban green, parks, playgrounds, play lots, green belt and other environmental-oriented spaces of the project without any permission of the court.’ However, RAJUK and CSCEC continued the construction of the Bangladesh-China Friendship Exhibition Center (BBCFEC) in potential violation of the law.

The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee.  The Government of Sri Lanka on-lent the proceeds of the GCL to Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) — the state-owned operator of major commercial ports in Sri Lanka. The end-user (SLPA) was expected to use proceeds of the loan to finance 100% of the cost of a $147 million commercial contract that it signed with a consortium consisting of China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) and Sinohydro Corporation Limited (SCL) on May 17, 2012. China Eximbank disbursed RMB 237,955,105.04 in 2013, RMB 120,862,986.24 in 2014, RMB 54,326,219.49 in 2015, and unknown amounts in subsequent years. The loan's amount outstanding was RMB 862,604,892 as of December 31, 2016 and RMB 632,576,921 as of June 30, 2022.  The purpose of the project was to deepen the harbor basin one additional meter, dredge for approaching channel, provide additional work on the oil terminal, generate breakwater and revetment modification and handling facilities, provide a new administration and services building, and change specification of navigational aid and price escalation.  CHEC and SCL were the contractors responsible for project implementation. Project implementation commenced on April 24, 2013 and reached completion on April 24, 2015.  However, Phases I and II of the Hambantota Port Development Project (HPDP) encountered financial management problems, debt repayment challenges, and corruption allegations. Hambantota Port generated lower-than-expected container traffic and proved to be commercially nonviable under SLPA ownership. Consequently, SLPA could not service its loans to China Eximbank. In response, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited (CMPort) — a subsidiary of China Merchants Group (a Chinese state-owned enterprise) — purchased a majority ownership stake in the port and the right to operate and develop it for 99 years.  More specifically, on July 29, 2017, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited (CMPort), a subsidiary of China Merchants Group, and Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA) signed a 99-year concession agreement and formed a joint venture to operate Hambantota Port. According to the terms of the joint venture agreement, CMPort acquired an 85% stake in Hambantota International Ports Group (HIPG) and a 49.3% stake in Hambantota International Port Services (HIPS), representing about 70% of the total equity. CMPort was also granted the operating and management rights of HIPG and HIPS as well as the lease and development rights of approximately 11.5 square kilometers of land in the Hambantota port area. CMPort agreed to make a total equity investment of $1.12 billion, of which $974 million would be used to acquire the 85% stake in HIPG and $146 million would be deposited into a bank account in the name of CMPort in Sri Lanka (for the expansion of Hambantota Port and shipping-related business).  According to a July 20, 2017 Cabinet Memorandum entitled ‘Hambantota Port Concession Agreement’ (No. MPS/SEC/2017/32) that was approved by Sri Lanka’s Cabinet on August 4, 2017, when the concession agreement was signed, responsibility for repayment of the China Eximbank loans that were contracted for the construction of Hambantota Port was transferred from SLPA to the General Treasury. Given that the General Treasury was also identified as the recipient of the $974 million cash infusion from CMPort, many media outlets and commentators reported that the arrangement represented a ‘debt-for-equity’ swap.  However, the Government of Sri Lanka continued to have difficulty servicing its debts to China Eximbank for Phases I and II of the HPDP after 2017. On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a ‘pre-emptive’ sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. This decision to suspend external debt service affected all of the China Eximbank loans that were issued for Phases I and II of the HPDP.  Another source of controversy arose in June 2018 when the New York Times reported that $7.6 million had been transferred from a Standard Chartered Bank account controlled by China Harbor Engineering Co. (labelled ‘HPDP Phase 2’) to affiliates of President Rajapaksa’s re-election campaign. The New York Times also reported that checks worth $1.2 million (linked to the ‘HPDP Phase 2’ bank account) were delivered to President Rajapaksa’s official residence.","Completion","Development","Loan","ODA-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company",158253283.558343,"On April 24, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Sri Lanka signed an RMB 960 million government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL (2013) 18 TOTAL NO.

The project supported a 21 km northern bypass segment and a 31 km eastern bypass segment. The northern bypass road starts in a neighborhood called Ruaka, approximately 16 kilometres (10 mi), north-west of the central business district of Nairobi, the capital and largest city of Kenya. From there, the road travels in a general easterly direction through Runda. It briefly crosses into Kiambu County, passes underneath Kiambu Road, re-enters Nairobi County and continues to a neighborhood called Marurui. At Marurui, the road takes a north-easterly direction, crosses Kamiti Road, then passes through Kahawa and re-enters Kiambu Couty, to end at the Nairobi Eastern Bypass Highway in Ruiru. The eastern bypass road starts at the junction of the Nairobi–Mombasa Road and Airport North Road, in Embakasi, immediately west of Nairobi International Airport, approximately 12 kilometres (7 mi) south-east of the city centre.The road then loops through the south-eastern suburbs of Nairobi, skirting the northern edges of Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, through Ruai. The road then crosses from Nairobi County, into Kiambu County and then turns westwards, passes underneath the Thika Highway and ends at the Ruiru Kamiti Road, at a place called Ruiru Road Junction.

The purpose of the first phase of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project was to construct a new eight-lane asphalt expressway stretching 78 km from Addis Ababa to Adama. The alignment starts from Tulu Dimtu. The main road of the expressway continues 2.8 km along the proposed Addis Adaba outer ring road and then crosses Dukem, Bishoftu and Modjo on their east side. It then passes the old Addis Adama road at 62km and bypasses around Adama on the south side. The expressway ends on the east side of Adama and connects to Adama Awash road. The expressway has 18 km of link road and 7.2 km of frontage road on either side in Adama. The road work involved the construction of six interchanges, three intersections, 77 slab culverts, 36 underpasses and 43 overpasses. The 5.4m-high overpasses are supported by 73t girders, reinforced concrete piers and stone structures. Pedestrians, agricultural vehicles and cars can use three of the underpasses. The underpass for agricultural vehicles has a width of 4.5m and a height of 3.2m. The pedestrian underpass is 4.5m wide and 2.2m high. Car underpasses are larger in size with 6.5m width and 4.5m height. Flood discharge was used to size the culverts, which was designed according to velocity, water scouring and water levels. The project also included the construction of two main toll gates and 13 ramp toll gates.   The ultimate objective of the project was to reduce the travel time on Ethiopia's main import-export route from three hours to one hour. The project also sought to lay the groundwork for the use of innovative technology via tolls and creates local employment opportunities. Upon completion, the project was expected to contribute to the development of roadways between the capital city and other regions, such as Hawassa and Bale.  The Addis-Adama Expressway (AAE) is fully access-controlled and managed by Ethiopian Toll Road Enterprise (ETRE). CCCC was the EPC contractor responsible for the implementation of the project’s first phase and second phase. Phase 1 construction began on April 21, 2010.  According to Samson Wondimu, the Communication Director of ERA, the project’s first phase had achieved a 33.6% completion rate as of April 2012. By September 2012, it had achieved a 50% completion rate. A completion ceremony for the first phase of the project was held on May 5, 2014. The second phase of the project (also known as the Lebu-Akaki-Information Technology Park Outer Ring Road Project, the Lebu-Akaki IT Park Outer Ring Road Project, and the Akaki-Goro and Akaki-Lebu Road Project) involved the construction of a 28.1 km toll road — with three lanes each 3.5 meters wide — that links Adama Town in Oromia State with Addis Ababa. Phase 2 supported two road sections: a 14.6 km Akaki-ICT Park (Goro) road section and a 13.6 km Akaki-Lebu road section. Phase 2 also involved the construction of six bridges, one railway line interchange, and three interchanges at Tulu Dimitu, Akaki and Lebu. Upon completion, the project’s second phase was expected to ease traffic congestion along the Akaki-Bishoftu corridor. Phase 2 began implementation on May 5, 2014 and was originally scheduled to reach completion within 25 months (June 5, 2016). By November 27, 2014, the second phase of the project had achieved a 27% completion rate. By June 2015, the second phase of the project had achieved a 50% completion rate. Phase 2 was ultimately completed on August 6, 2016.   After the completion of first and second phases of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project, traffic volumes on the expressway reportedly exceeded 20,000 vehicles per day on the two-lane road trunk road between Addis Ababa and Adama. In October 2019, an official from the Ethiopian Toll Roads Enterprise (ETRE) reported that around 33 million cars had used the toll expressway over the previous five years, generating around $34 million of revenue for the country. However, according to an October 2021 report, '[a]fter 5 years [the expressway] has earned back only about $30 million in toll revenue, well short of expectations. Ethiopia built the toll road parallel to an existing free highway, and a lot of the traffic has remained on the old road.'  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs.

The loan was then approved by Gabon's President and Council of Ministers on February 21, 2013. The GCL carries a 20 year maturity and a 2.5% interest rate. The proceeds of the loan were used by the borrower to finance a 2009 commercial contract between Sinohydro Engineering Bureau 4 Co. Ltd and Gabon’s Ministry of Energy and Water Resources and the Ministry of Economy and Trade.   The project involved the construction of a substation in Angondje, the expansion of two substations in Ambowe and Bissegué, and the construction three overhead transmission lines and two underground cable transmission lines measuring 130 km in length.   Sinohydro Engineering Bureau 4 Co. Ltd was the contractor responsible for implementation. Its ultimate objective was to better connect Libreville to surrounding areas. Its work was overseen by the Electricity Office of Energy and Hydraulic Resources Department of the Government of Gabon. The project officially commenced on June 10, 2011. As of May 2014, the new substation in Angondje, the expansion of the two substations in Ambowe (Ntoum) and Bissegué, and the construction of a 23 km underground cable transmission line from Ambowe to Owendo (connecting to the Ambowe-Owendo power plant) were completed. Although this project was completed, it precise completion date is unknown.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Libreville Electricity Network Renovation Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  In mid-2014, a decline in international oil prices generated sharp reductions in Gabon’s oil exports and fiscal revenues. The country’s rising fiscal deficit led to the accumulation of arrears to external creditors. By 2017, the stock of the Government of Gabon’s external arrears stood at $115 million, including arrears to China, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Israel, and South Korea. All of these arrears were successfully cleared by 2020. However, the Government of Gabon accumulated $3 million of additional arrears to Chinese creditors in 2020.  By the end of May 2021, ‘the stock of [the Government of] Gabon’s external arrears stood at CFAF 98.03 billion (US$182.1 million), including CFAF 23.8 billion (US$44.2 million) vis-à-vis multilaterals and CFAF 21.05 billion (US$39.1 million) vis-à-vis government agencies and private creditors insured with companies from Paris Club member countries and from China [ICBC and China Construction Bank] CFAF 1.3 billion (US$2.42 million). The Government's strategy for the clearance of existing external arrears consists of focusing primarily on multilateral debt, bilateral debt, insured commercial commitments and seeking agreements with other creditors prior to the IMF Board meeting. Accordingly, we will clear the arrears vis-à-vis the multilaterals. We will also clear bilateral and commercial-insured arrears as follows: (i) Austria CFAF 6.83 billion (US$12.69 million); (ii) France CFAF 11.9 billion (US$22.11 million); (iii) Israel CFAF 2.23 billion (US$4.13 million); and Spain CFAF 0.09 billion (US$0.17 million).

The estimated borrowing terms of the PBC are as follows: 20 year maturity, 5 year grace period, and 3% interest rate. The final maturity date of the PBC is January 21, 2030. Semi-annual loan repayments were scheduled to begin on January 21, 2015 and end on January 21, 2030. The loan entered into force on May 7, 2010. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 95% of the cost of a commercial contract between MWSSS and China International Water and Electric Company (CWE), which was signed in mid-2009.   The purpose of the project was to transport raw water from Angat Dam to the La Mesa Dam and then onward to a set of water treatment plants in La Mesa and Balara (by repairing a leaky, 15 km irrigation canal called Aqueduct No 5). Upon completion of the project, it was expected that Rizal, Cavite, and Bulacan provinces in Quezon City would have greater access to clean water and MWSS would recover an estimated 394 million liters of water that was being lost each day because of the leaky aqueduct. CWE received a construction start order from MWSS on March 16, 2010.   Construction commenced on March 17, 2010. The EPC contract went into effect on May 9, 2010. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 28, 2010. The project was originally scheduled to be completed in March 2013 but it was completed eight months ahead of schedule and officially inaugurated on July 17, 2012. The project was issued a temporary completion certificate on September 10, 2012. A final project completion certificate was issued on September 25, 2013.   However, this project was also a source of local controversy. In February 2011, the Philippine Large Diameter Pressure Pipe Manufacturers Association urged the new MWSS board members appointed by President Aquino to rescind the commercial contract that was issued to CWE. It alleged that limiting the bidding among three Chinese state-owned firms violated the country’s procurement law. The Philippine Large Diameter Pressure Pipe Manufacturers Association also said the contract price was excessive compared to the cost of the Phase 1 of the Angat Water Utilisation and Aqueduct Improvement Project, which was carried out by three of its members. The MWSS board, however, did not act on the association’s recommendation to rescind the contract.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company",162391960.713841,"The purpose of the project was to transport raw water from Angat Dam to the La Mesa Dam and then onward to a set of water treatment plants in La Mesa and Balara (by repairing a leaky, 15 km irrigation canal called Aqueduct No 5).

57586,"China (People's Republic of)","Cameroon","Africa",2017,NA,"China Eximbank provides $141.8 million buyer’s credit loan for Phase 2 of 211 MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project (Linked to Project ID#289)","On February 28, 2017, China Eximbank signed an a buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement with Cameroon's Ministry of Power and Water Resources worth $141,839,830 for Phase 2 of the 211 MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. The borrowing terms of the BCL are as follows: a 15 year maturity, a 3 year grace period, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 320 basis points. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the BCL to partially finance the cost of a commercial contract between Cameroon’s Ministry of Water and Energy and Sinohydro Corporation. As of December 31, 2020, the loan (BCL) had achieved a 90.9% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 6.9 billion) and the its outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 69.1 billion.   The purpose of the project is to evacuate 211MW of electricity from the Memve'ele dam (on River Ntem) to Yaounde. The project scope includes (1) the construction of 294 pylons between Nyabizan and Ebolowa; (2) the installation of a 225kV, 280 km electricity transmission line between Nyabissan (Memve'ele), Ebolowa and Ahala substations; (3) deviation of the existing 225kV Mangombé-Oyomabang single-circuit electricity transmission line and the existing 90kV Edéa-Yaoundé single-circuit electricity transmission line; (4) the construction of two new Ebolowa and Nkol Nkumu 225kV substations; and (5) extension of the existing Ahala substation from 90kV to 225kV. Upon completion, these transmission lines to Ebolowa and substations are expected to connect the dam to Cameroon’s southern network and to Yaoundé. Sinohydro 16th Bureau is the contractor responsible for project implementation. The project construction began in 2011 and the dam was completed since June 2017, but energy evacuation works are being built and it is expected to be announced in August 2020.  As of September 30, 2021, the construction of the Nyabizan-Yaoundé evacuation line had achieved a 92% completion rate (and at least 280 of the 294 pylons were installed). However, the completion of the project (commissioning of the dam) depends on payment of compensation to the people affected by the transmission line’s corridor.  The people located along a 5 km route of this 270 km line are claiming nearly FCFA 3 billion (EUR 5 million) in compensation, and as of December 2021, this issue had not been resolved (after several failed attempts and deadlines). In late June 2021, during a special plenary session of the National Assembly, Cameroon’s Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Essomba provided an update on the status of the project. He explained that “Memve’ele hydroelectric plant is already injecting 90MW of energy into the South Interconnected Network” and “once the 225kV line is completed […] the volume of production injected will rise to 211 MW.” However, according to Sinohydro 16th Bureau, the hydroelectric power plant will not operate at full capacity after the completion of the 280 km electricity transmission line between Nyabizan and Ebolowa because of the flow of the Ntem River.  The company’s experts believe claim that the flow of the Ntem River will not be sufficient to regularly drive the power plant’s four (52.75 MW) turbines.   The solution suggested by Sinohydro 16th Bureau is the construction of a reservoir and the project is reportedly being ‘fine-tuned’ to address this issue. According to the Government of Cameroon, the revenue generated by the Memve’ele hydroelectric power plant and Nyabizan-Yaoundé transmission line since ‘powering up’ from April 2019 to October 2021 amounts to CFAF 45 billion. In addition, the partial completion of the 211MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project enabled the shutdown of the Ahala, Oyom-Abang, Mbalmayo and Ebolowa thermal power stations, which has led to a substantial reduction in the fuel costs that were previously borne by the Government of Cameroon. Phase 1 of the project was also financed by China Eximbank in 2012 and completed in 2016 (as captured via Project ID#289).  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 2 of the 211MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.’","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Recipient Government Agency|Chinese State-owned Company",163447448.294368,"The purpose of the project is to evacuate 211MW of electricity from the Memve'ele dam (on River Ntem) to Yaounde.

The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was to use the proceeds of the PBC to partially finance a $169 million commercial (EPC) contract between State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) and Électricité du Laos (EDL).   The purpose of the project was to construct a 94.1-kilometer 230-kilovolt Pak Ngeuy–Pha Oudom transmission line, a 21.9-kilometer 115-kilovolt Pak Ngeuy–Nampen transmission line, a new 230-kilovolt substation in Pha Oudom, and an expanded 230-kilovolt substation in Pak Ngeuy.   SGCC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. The project commenced in March 2016 and was completed on July 27, 2018. At the end of July 2018, the substation in Pha Oudom conducted live commissioning and was handed over to EDL in August 2018. The well-coordinated transfer enabled Nam Tha River No. 1 Hydropower Plant to produce electricity for surrounding provinces such as Bokeo and Luang Namtha.    There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the 230kV Pak Ngeuy-Pha Oudom Transmission Line and Associated Substation Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. Laos’ gross foreign exchange reserves were dangerously low between 2019 and 2021, hovering between 1.4 and 2.3 months of import cover, and total public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt increased from 68 percent of GDP ($12.5 billion) in 2019 to 88 percent in 2021 of GDP (or $14.5 billion). According to a report published by the World Bank in April 2022, ‘[t]he energy sector, mostly represented by Électricité du Laos (EDL), accounted for over 30 percent of total PPG debt in 2021. […] EDL’s debt service obligations [were] still unsustainable [at the time], with future debt service accounting for about two fifths of EDL’s total operating revenue.’ The Laotian authorities sought and secured debt service payment deferrals from their Chinese creditors in 2020 and 2021; according to the World Bank, ‘[d]ebt service deferrals granted by major lenders in 2020-2021 amounted around 3.6 percent of GDP in 2021’ and ’[a]s a result, actual debt service payments are estimated to have declined to 48 percent of total revenues in 2021, compared to 65 percent in the 2021 [Government of Laos] plan.’  The country’s central bank (Bank of the Lao P.D.R) also made a $300 million drawdown under its currency swap agreement with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in June 2020 — when its gross reserves stood at only 1.5 months of import cover and credit rating agencies warned of a high default probability. Then, in 2021, the short-term emergency loan from the PBOC was ‘rolled over’ for another year. Around the same time, a Chinese state-owned enterprise purchased a major public infrastructure asset in Laos—a large part of the country’s electricity transmission grid—from EDL as part of an apparent debt-for-equity swap. China Southern Power Grid Co. and EDL established a joint venture known as Électricité du Laos Transmission Company Limited (EDLT) in September 2020.  China Southern Power Grid Co. purchased a 90% ownership stake in EDLT in exchange for a $600 million fee (equity infusion). Then, in March 2021, EDLT signed a 25-year concession agreement, which made it responsible for management of the country’s high-voltage transmission network above 230 kilovolts. Independent observers suggested at the time that EDL would likely use the $600 million upfront payment from China Southern Power Grid Co. to service its outstanding debts to Chinese creditors, although this has not been independently confirmed. According to the World Bank’s International Debt Statistics, the Government of Laos was responsible for making average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $232 million between 2019 and 2019 and average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $60 million between 2020 and 2021 (a substantially lower figure due to payment deferrals); however, it expected to make average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth nearly $678 million over the next seven years (2022-2028).","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Recipient State-owned Company",165533376.256062,"The purpose of the project was to construct a 94.1-kilometer 230-kilovolt Pak Ngeuy–Pha Oudom transmission line, a 21.9-kilometer 115-kilovolt Pak Ngeuy– Nampen transmission line, a new 230-kilovolt substation in Pha Oudom, and an expanded 230-kilovolt substation in Pak Ngeuy.

This loan carried a 1.5% interest rate and a 5 year grace period, but the maturity length is unknown. The proceeds of the GCL were on-lent to Société National de Ciment Tchad (SONACIM Tchad), a Chadian state-owned company that was established to manage the Baoré Cement Factory. The ultimate borrower (SONACIM Tchad) the use the proceeds of the GCL to finance a commercial contract with China CAMC  Engineering Co, Ltd..  The Baoré Cement Factory Project involved the construction of a cement plant with annual production capacity of 200,000 tons as well as a dedicated heavy fuel oil (HFO) power station, mining equipment and access roads. The plant occupies an area of 17 hectares and it is located in the village of Bissi Kéda within Mayo Kebbi West State (approximately 8km from the limestone quarries in Baoaré). Beijing Triumph Materials Engineering Design Co. was the contractor responsible for project design and China CAMC Engineering Co, Ltd. was the contractor responsible for implementation. To control the quality of the cement that is produced, a modern laboratory adjoins the factory; it is used to analyze samples taken at random to verify their compliance with international standards.   The project commenced on December 17, 2007 and the factory was officially completed and put into production on February 16, 2012. Chad's President Idriss Deby, Prime Minister Emmanuel Nadingar, and Chinese Ambassador Yang Guangyu attended the opening ceremony for the factory. The region where the cement plant is located has three quarries with 7 million tonnes of limestone. It also abounds in clay, laterite and sand, three raw materials that go into the manufacture of cement. The cement plant reportedly employs 300 Chadian workers and 100 Chinese workers.  There are indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Baoré Cement Factory Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  After a sharp decline in oil prices in 2014-2015, Chad experienced an economic recession and a debt crisis and its government sought to renegotiate the borrowing terms of the China Eximbank loan for the Baoré Cement Factory Project. A rescheduling agreement was finalized in April 2017: China Eximbank agreed to the lengthen the maturity of the loan and reschedule arrears that had accumulated (as captured via Project ID#55744).

Project ID#54106 captures the $15 million contribution from China Eximbank and Project ID#71101 captures the $15 million contribution from CDB. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown.   Then, in 2012, TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC (特变电工杜尚别矿业有限 or 特变电工杜尚别矿业有限公司 or ТВЕА Душанбе горная промышленность) — a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of TBEA — signed a $179 million loan agreement with China Eximbank for the Phase 1 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project (captured via Project ID#91801). The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the loan was part of a trilateral ‘resources-for-infrastructure’ agreement between the Tajik Ministry of Energy, TBEA, and TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC. Under the terms of the ‘resources-for-infrastructure’ agreement, TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC agreed to ‘front’ $179 million for the construction of Phase 1 by borrowing directly from China Eximbank, and, in turn, the Tajik Government agreed to grant TBEA exclusive rights to explore and develop gold deposits at the Eastern Duoba mine and the Upper Kumarg mine (until TBEA could recoup its investment). The Tajik Government also reportedly agreed to give TBEA the rights to further mining deposits (at an unidentified location) if the profit made from the gold deposits at the Eastern Duoba mine and the Upper Kumarg mine did not cover the cost of Phase 1 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. Also, as part of the ‘resources-for-infrastructure’ agreement, TBEA was reportedly exempted from paying customs duties and value added tax (VAT) on imported equipment necessary for exploration and development of the deposits. The tax and customs exemptions were scheduled to cease once TBEA recouped its initial costs. However, the agreement allowed TBEA to continue to mine the gold deposits for profit after the expiration of the exemptions.   Then, on November 7, 2014, the the Government of Tajikistan and the Export-Import Bank of China signed two loan agreements — a RMB 929,977,078 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2014) 30 TOTAL NO. (553)] and a $178,969,220 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2014) 40 TOTAL NO. (34)] for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. The GCL is captured via Project ID#46211 and the PBC is captured via Project ID#71137. Both of these loans were ratified by the Tajik Parliament on January 14, 2015. The GCL was contracted by the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and it carried the following borrowing terms: a 25 year maturity, an 11 year grace period, and a 1.5% interest rate. The PBC carries a 20 year maturity, a 9 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The Government of Tajikistan contributed $17,443,400 of counterpart financing. In total, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan contracted $331,058,220 of China Eximbank debt for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. The Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds of the GCL and the PBC to on-lend to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) “Barqi Tojik”. OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” was a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy. The subsidiary GCL agreement (#TАJ 2014-028-2) was signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” on December 18, 2014. It carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 25 years. Its final maturity date was set to August 21, 2039. The subsidiary PBC agreement (#TАJ 2014-028-1) was also signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” on December 18, 2014 and it carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 20 years. Its final maturity date was set to June 21, 2034.   The PBC’s amount outstanding was TJS 808,004,000 as of December 31, 2016, TJS 1,343,913,000 as of December 31, 2017, TJS 1,436,962,000 as of December 31, 2018, TJS 1,476,217,000 as of December 31, 2019, and TJS 2,022,352,000 as of December 31, 2020. The GCL’s amount outstanding was TJS 1,054,408,000 as of December 31, 2016, TJS 1,259,654,000 as of December 31, 2017, TJS 1,274,255,000 as of December 31, 2018, TJS 1,288,762,000 as of December 31, 2019, and TJS 1,610,069,000 as of December 31, 2020.  Dushanbe 2 is a combined heat and power plant (CHP) — also known as the Dushanbe-2 Thermal Power Plant (TPS-2) — that provides heat and electricity for the residents of Dushanbe. It only operates in the winter. The 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project was designed and implemented in two phases. The power plant was to be fueled by coal, with the potential to switch to gas. Phase 1 (mainly constructed between 2012-2014) installed a capacity of 100 MW, while Phase 2 (constructed between 2014-2016) installed an additional capacity of 300 MW. TBEA was the general contractor responsible for implementation of both phases. Henan No 1 Thermal Power Construction Company was also involved in the implementation of Phase 1. Inner Mongolia Electric Power Survey and Design Institute Co., Ltd. was the contractor responsible for the design for Phase 2. Hydro Electric Power System Engineering Company was also involved in the implementation of Phase 2.   Phase 1 was originally scheduled to be completed and put into production before the celebration of the 20th anniversary of Tajik independence in 2011 (on September 9, 2011), and the second phase was scheduled to be completed in 2013. A formal groundbreaking ceremony for Phase 1 took place on September 8, 2009. However, construction did not begin until November 2012. Phase 1 was completed on September 13, 2014 and the first two (50MW) power generation units were put into operation on November 10, 2014. Phase 2 began on May 14, 2015 and was completed on December 8, 2016. According to President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon as relayed by TBEA, the power plant generates 9.6 million kWh power per day and 235 trillion Kcal heat, and it provides nearly 700 stable jobs to Tajiks. The electricity generated from the power plant is sold to Barki Tojik Open Stock Holding Power under a power purchase agreement. Through this project, 150 Tajik technicians went to China for training, and about 100 Tajik operators received professional know-how from Chinese experts. According to Xinhua, the completed power plant met 60 percent of the power demand and restarted the provision of central heating to more than 700,000 Dushanbe residents after 15 years of suspension. The completion of the power plant was declared to be a solution to Tajikistan's long-existing issue of power shortages during the winter.   However, it appears that the project’s second phase has encountered revenue generation and loan repayment problems. In 2018, the Government of Tajikistan reportedly granted a gold mining license to TBEA as ‘remuneration’ for Phase 2. Media reports indicate that TBEA agreed to work on the gold deposits as long as it takes to recoup the costs that it incurred during the construction of Phase 2. Several years later, in November 2021, TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC reported that it had completed half of the work on the construction of the gold processing plant and ancillary facilities in Ayni district of the northern province of Sughd, Tajikistan. The purpose of these facilities is to support the development of the Kumarghi Bolo (Upper Kumargh) and Duobai Sharqi (Eastern Duoba) gold deposits. TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC completed geological exploration works on the Upper Kumarg gold mine in October 2016.  There are also some indications that the China Eximbank loans for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to a 2021 IMF report, ‘[OHSHC “Barqi Tojik”] has significant arrears to the government on [foreign exchange] denominated loans. The government on-lends concessional [foreign exchange] loans […] from multilateral and bilateral agencies to [OHSHC “Barqi Tojik”] on non-concessional terms. These loans are denominated in [foreign exchange] and are intended to develop the energy infrastructure. However, these debts are not serviced fully, resulting in [foreign exchange] arrears to the government.’ A 2021 report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) elaborated on this point, explaining that ‘[a] high rate of uncollected payments for electricity use due to illegal connections, power theft and outdated metering infrastructure contribute to the worsening financial health of Barki Tojik.’ Then, in March 2023, the IMF published a report, which noted that ‘[I]n 2021 the SOE sector […] kept accumulating debt service losses, where within a year the amount of debt overdue payments […] increased from TJS 14 billion to TJS 17 billion (17.1 percent of GDP).

Then, on November 2, 2012, the Government of Guyana and China Eximbank signed an RMB 825,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL No. (2012) 32 Total No. (434) No. 1420203052012112030] for the Cheddi Jagan International Airport Expansion Project. The GCL (loan) carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 5 year grace period, a 20 year maturity, a management fee of 0.75% (RMB 6,187,500), and a commitment fee of 0.5%. As of December 31, 2020, the loan’s total amount outstanding (including principal and capitalized interest) was RMB 673,698,000. The proceeds of the GCL were to be used by the borrower to finance 94.2% of the cost of a $138,000,000 commercial contract between Guyana’s Ministry of Public Works and Communications and China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) Ltd., which was signed on November 11, 2011.  The purpose of this project was to expand Cheddi Jagan International Airport at Timehri, 40 km from the capital city of Georgetown, and the Ogle Municipal Aerodrome on the East Coast of Demerara. Cheddi Jagan International Airport is Guyana's main airport. The project involved a 3.3 km extension of the airport runaway to accommodate Boeing 747-sized aircraft, the building of a new construction terminal, the introduction of a departure control system, the installation of a CCTV system with approximately 300 cameras, the installation of passenger boarding bridges, elevators, and escalators, and the acquisition of new equipment. The existing 7,448 ft long runway was to be extended to 10,800 ft to make it a category Code 4E runway and to enable it to accommodate the Boeing 747-400 aircraft.   CHEC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony for the project took place on March 23, 2013. Construction of the terminal and runway was originally expected to begin in March 2013 and reach completion 32 months later (December 2015). However, this project encountered various problems and delays. On October 12, 2013, CHEC employees were violently robbed by cutlass-wielding individuals (Source ID: 151254). Then, in September 2015, the collapse of a pit killed a worker working on the project (Source ID: 151255). The country's political opposition also raised objections about the cost of the project and delayed its implementation. In January 2015, the then Alliance for Change (AFC) Vice Chairman, Moses Nagamootoo, criticized the project in the media. It appears the AFC, then-an opposition party, was opposed to the project, supporting its abandonment for a new airport on the West Bank of Demerara at Sandhills. The opposition blocked funding for the project in 2014. Nagamootoo called the project a ‘fly by night project’, and was accused of misleading the public as to why Guyana used China Eximbank to finance the project. Nagamootoo later that year was sworn in as the new Prime Minister of Guyana. (Source ID: 151253). As of 2019, the project was still not complete and the Government of Guyana's contract with China Harbour Engineering Company expired on December 31, 2018. In 2019, Guyana's Auditor General, Deodat Sharma, launched a full value-for-money audit into the Cheddi Jagan International Airport (CJIA) Expansion Project. Significant concerns arose about the project running over budget. As of December 31, 2017, $111.79 million had been spent on the project. However, the total cost of the project eventually escalated to more than $160 million. As of December 2021, project implementation was still underway and Guyana’s Minister of Public Works, Juan Edghill, promised that the total cost for the project would not exceed $200 million. During a visit to the project site in September 2020, the country’s former Auditor General, Anand Goolsarran, pointed out that President Irfaan Ali had identified 71 defects that needed to be rectified. President Irfaan conveyed that the Government of Guyana would only accept completed works based on the original contract entered into in November 2011. Then, in April 2022, Anand Goolsarran told the media that the Cheddi Jagan International Airport Expansion Project had ‘failed completely’ to deliver in terms of their objectives, outputs, outcomes and impacts, thereby ‘encumbering the Guyana’s public debt […] with little or nothing to show for the expenditure incurred’. He noted that construction was still ongoing after ten years, with a revised completion date of June 20, 2022. He argued that project’s underperformance was related to the absence of feasibility and economic visibility studies prior to the issuing of the commercial contract (to determine the precise nature and scope of the works to be undertaken. He also noted that the project had suffered from a lack of effective supervision as the works progressed. Additionally, he pointed out that the $138 million commercial contract was awarded to CHEC in November 2011 — only ten days before the November 2011 national and regional elections.","Implementation","Development","Loan","ODA-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Recipient State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company",169051537.906967,"The Cheddi Jagan International Airport is located in Timehri.

Then, on April 5, 2017, China Eximbank formally issued a $675.5 million ‘mixed credit’ to the Government of the Republic of Cameroon for Phase 2. It provided an RMB 1 billion government concessional loan (GCL) (captured via Project ID#53116) and a $524,579,992 preferential buyer's credit (PBC) loan (captured via Project ID#53396).   The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 2% interest rate, and a 7 year grace period. The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 22 year maturity, a 2% interest rate, and a 11 year grace period. Both loans were secured by (i.e. collateralized against) the revenues of the Autonomous Port of Kribi, which were to be deposited by the borrower into an escrow account (known as the ‘Control Account’).  The proceeds of the GCL and the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract between China Harbour Engineering Company Limited and Cameroon's Ministry of Economy, Planning and Regional Development (MINEPAT).   As of December 31, 2020, the GCL had achieved a 21.1% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 64.9 billion) and its amount outstanding was equivalent to CFA 17.3 billion. As of December 31, 2020, the PBC had achieved a 25.6% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 200.9 billion) and its amount outstanding was equivalent to CFA 31.4 billion.

China Eximbank also supported the Phase 1 of the Kribi Deep Sea Port Project (as captured via Project ID#350).  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the first and second phases of the Kribi Deep Sea Port Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress.

26602,"China (People's Republic of)","Zimbabwe","Africa",2018,NA,"China Eximbank provides RMB 1.045 billion government concessional loan for Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport Expansion Project","On December 6, 2017, the Chinese Government and the Government of Zimbabwe signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) regarding the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport Expansion Project. Then, on April 8, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Zimbabwe signed an RMB 1,045,139,500 ($153 million loan) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport Expansion Project. The Government of Zimbabwe on-lent the proceeds of the loan to the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe (CAAZ). The GCL carries the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity period, a 7 grace period, an interest rate of 2% per year, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee. The borrower is expected to deposit the proceeds from the Air Infrastructure Development Fund and passenger services charges at Harare International Airport into an escrow account with Stanbic (to facilitate the repayment of the loan and as a source of de facto collateral). The escrow account is jointly monitored by the Government of Zimbabwe and China Eximbank.   As of August 2020, the loan had achieved a 85.7% disbursement rate ($131.2 million out of $153 million). Additional disbursements worth $27.8 million took place in 2022, bringing the loan disbursement rate to at least 100%. The loan’s amount outstanding (including principal, interest, and arrears) was $81,231,518.01 as of 2021. The purpose of the project is to construct a new international terminal building at Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport with a construction area of ​​35,000 square meters, a new VIP building, and a satellite command center. It also involves maintenance on the existing 1.6 km runway, parking lot, and control tower, and the transformation of the existing terminal building and fire center. The project will also seek to increase the airport’s handling capacity from 2.5 million people per year to six million people per year. China Jiangsu International is the contractor responsible for project implementation.    On July 23, 2018, an official project commencement ceremony was held. The project was originally expected to reach completion within 36 months (July 23, 2021). However, this project has been plagued by scandal, controversy, and delay. In 2019, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe diverted $10 million from the project’s escrow account. China Eximbank then halted disbursements for the project and said that it would not release additional funds until the $10 million withdrawal was returned. It appears that this condition was eventually met because project implementation continued in 2020 and 2021. On February 26, 2020, Chinese Ambassador Guo Shaochun visited Zimbabwe to inspect the airport reconstruction. As of July 2020, the project achieved a 27% completion rate. China Eximbank also made a $27.7 million loan disbursement in 2020. Then, on September 1, 2021, President Mnangagwa of Zimbabwe visited the project site.    In mid-2022, the Debt Management Office of Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance released a report, which provided evidence that the China Eximbank loan for the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport Expansion Project has financially underperformed. It noted that ‘[t]he low disbursements of loans is due to accumulation of arrears to active China Eximbank loans […] on projects such as the Victoria Falls International Airport ($54 million), NetOne network expansion ($61 million) and expansion of the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport ($3 million).’ It also noted that, by the end of 2021, total external debt arrears to China Eximbank included $13 million for the NetOne Expansion Phase 1 Project, $47 million for the NetOne Expansion Phase 2 Project, $67 million for the Rehabilitation of Municipal Water and Sewage Treatment Works Project (City of Harare Project), $7 million for the National Defence College Project, $54 million for the Victoria Falls Airport Renovation and Expansion Project, $3 million for the Robert G. Mugabe International Airport Expansion Project, $0.5 million for Phase 2 of the TelOne Broadband Expansion Project, and $73 million for the Medical Equipment and Supplies Project.     As of August 2022, the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport Expansion Project had achieved a 67% completion rate and the Government of Zimbabwe had taken delivery 3 (out of 5) radars to support an air traffic control system.

Then on January 18, 2016, CMG and the Djibouti Port and Free Trade Zone Authority (DPFZA) held a signing ceremony for a framework agreement for the Djibouti International Free Trade Zone (DIFTZ) Expansion Project. CMG then signed a project contract on January 15, 2017. Three days later, on January 18, 2017, Khor Ambado Free Zone Co. (FZCO or Djibouti Asset Company) — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture between Port of Dalian Authority Group (10% equity stake), China Merchants Shekou Industrial Zone Holdings (招商局蛇口工业区控股股份有限公司) (6% equity stake), China Merchants Investment Development Co., Ltd (CMID) (12% ownership stake), China Merchants Port Holdings Co., Ltd (12% ownership stake), and the Djibouti Ports & Free Zones Authority (DPFZA) (60% equity stake) — was established (legally incorporated) to develop commercial and infrastructure projects within the Djibouti International Free Trade Zone (DIFTZ). Then, on November 10, 2017, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited (CMP) issued a $150 million supplier’s credit (‘CMP Loan Facility’) agreement with Khor Ambado Free Zone Co. for the Djibouti International Free Trade Zone (DIFTZ) Expansion Project. The CMP loan, captured via Project ID#59393, carried the following borrowing terms: a 5% annual interest rate, a 1.25-year maturity (with the option to extend the maturity by 8.75 additional years), and no grace period.   The Government of Djibouti — through the state-owned Djibouti Port and Free Trade Zone Authority (DPFZA) — issued a sovereign guarantee for repaying the supplier's credit. The loan was collateralized by a share pledge over 15.3% of the shares held by Great Horn Investment Holdings SAS (a subsidiary of DPFZA) in a China-Djibouti joint venture called Port De Djibouti S.A., which is co-owned the Government of Djibouti (76.5% equity stake) and China Merchants Port Holdings Company Ltd. (23.5% equity stake). Khor Ambado Free Zone Co. used the supplier's credit (loan) facility to on-lend to Port De Djibouti S.A. (PDSA).  Then, in 2019, China Development Bank and Khor Ambado Free Zone Co. signed a $240 million loan agreement (ID#4430201901100002407) for the Djibouti International Free Trade Zone (DIFTZ) Expansion Project. The CDB loan, which is captured via Project ID#85139, carried the following borrowing terms: a 13 year maturity and a 3 year grace period. China Merchants Shekou Industrial Zone Holdings Co., Ltd. provided a loan guarantee worth $14.4 million (6% of $240 million CDB loan). The Government of Djibouti provided a sovereign guarantee for 60% of the face value of the loan ($144 million). The DIFTZ is a 40-hectare zone that consists of three functional blocks located close to all of Djibouti’s major ports.   The purpose of the DIFTZ is to support industries such as the logistics, marine, construction, automotive, and home electrical industries. It is equipped with advanced facilities including high-speed telecommunications, power and water supplies, roads and parking lots. The pilot zone has four industrial clusters which focus on trade and logistics, export processing and business support: (1) Logistics Industry Cluster: transportation, bonded warehousing, logistics and distribution; (2) Business Industry Cluster: bulk bonded goods transactions, merchandise display, duty-free merchandise retail; (3) Business Support Cluster: financial services, information services, hotel dormitories, office buildings, training, intermediary services; and (4) Processing Manufacturing Cluster: packaging production, light processing of incoming materials, food processing, marine products, auto parts assembly.   China Merchants Holdings (Djibouti) FZE (“CM Djibouti”) was the company responsible for project implementation. On January 16, 2017, Djiboutian President Guelleh and General Manager of China Merchants Group Hu Jianhua unveiled the launch area and laid a foundation stone for the DIFTZ expansion project. The first phase of the project, which involved upgrading and expanding the port facilities of DIFTZ, was officially opened on July 5, 2018.  There are some indications that the $150 million CMP loan for the DIFTZ expansion project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  In September 2018, the Government of Djibouti nationalized the Dolareh Container Terminal (DCT), an asset held by PDSA. The change in DCT ownership affected PDSA's expected profits because PDSA's profits included dividend receivables from DCT. As a result, the potential chargeable interest on the CMP loan facility, which would be determined in part by PDSA profits, was rendered invalid. The DCT nationalization also affected DPFZA's share pledge value.

The PBC, which is captured via Project ID#54149, carried the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The Government of Uzbekistan issued a sovereign guarantee for this loan.

The Fund for Reconstruction and Development of Uzbekistan, O'zimyosanoat, O'zavtosanoat, the Navoi Mining and Smelting Plant, and Almalyk Mining and Smelting Plant reportedly funded the equity portion, although the breakdown of the $57.53 million equity portion is unknown.   The purpose of the project was to construct a tire plant — known as the Birinchi Rubber Engineering Plant (BRZ) — in Angren Special Economic Zone. Upon completion, the plant's production capacity was originally expected to be 3 million car tires, 200,000 agricultural tires, and 100,000 linear meters of conveyor belts for cleaning equipment per year.   China Poly Group Corporation Limited and CITIC Construction Co., Ltd. were the contractors responsible for project implementation. All production equipment and processes were sourced from China. Construction began on August 28, 2015 and was expected to last 34 months. The first tire was produced on trial on September 1, 2017, and production gradually increased during the end of 2017. The project was officially completed on July 25, 2018.   However, the tire plant and the loan that supported its construction underperformed vis-a-vis their original expectations. In 2020, the Government of Uzbekistan provided an emergency loan worth 40 billion soums (about $4 million) — through its Anti-Crisis Fund — to keep the tire plant financially afloat. Then, in September 2021, the Deputy Speaker of the Legislative Chamber of Oliy Majlis, Alisher Kadyrov, revealed that the tire plant was only operating at 15% capacity.

Zimbabwean Vice President Joyce Mujuru signed the loan agreement in Harare. The loan agreement followed the signing of a 2010 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) by the Chinese Government and Government of Zimbabwe for the financing of various development projects. Officials from Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance, representatives from China Eximbank and Sinosure signed the MOU. Sinosure agreed to provide insurance cover for various loans issued by China Eximbank. The BCL that was issued on March 21, 2011 carried the following borrowing terms: an 11 year maturity, a 4 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3% margin, a 0.375% management fee, and a 0.375% commitment fee.    However, its face value was subsequently revised to $140,825,714.38. The purpose of this project was to support the development and rehabilitation of water works and sewers in the Zimbabwe’s capital, Harare. More specifically, the proceeds of the loan were to be used to rehabilitate, replace, install and commission equipment at the Morton Jaffray water treatment plant, the Prince Edward Water Treatment plant, the Crowborough sewage plant, the Firle sewage plant, and pump stations at Warren Control, Alex Park, and Letombo. Some of the loan proceeds were also earmarked for information technology and automated billing activities, the acquisition of water treatment chemicals, the installation of laboratory, the installation of pressure-reducing valves, and the installation of prepaid meters in 500,000 households.  China National Machinery and Equipment Corporation (CNMEC) was the contractor responsible for implementation of the project.     This project officially entered into force on January 26, 2013, but it was plagued by various delays and controversies. In 2013, China Eximbank reportedly withheld loan disbursements due to the Government of Zimbabwe’s failure to meet its outstanding obligation under a 1997 loan that it provided to Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Industries (See Project ID#17125). In September 2013, 19 Chinese engineers joined a larger 46 engineer team to work on the project. Then, in June 2014, the deadline for project completion was pushed forward from April 2016 to June 2015. As of June 2014, several areas previously not receiving water had access and obsolete equipment was removed from facilities, the Morton Jaffray water treatment plant was operating at 70 percent capacity, and two pressure-reducing valves were installed at Warren Park D and Ardbennie.   A month later, in July 2014, an investigation was launched after the Harare City Council was accused of spending $8 million of the loan proceeds to purchase 25 luxury vehicles. Harare City Council insisted that the vehicles were for service deliveries; however, China Eximbank decided to withhold loan disbursements after learning that the loan proceeds were not being used for the intended purposes. As of June 2017, only half of the China Eximbank loan (approximately $72 million) had been disbursed. As of February 2020, China Eximbank was still withholding loan disbursements for this project. There is also evidence that the Government of Zimbabwe has fallen behind on its loan repayment schedule. As of 2018, the borrower had accumulated principal and interest arrears and penalties worth $28,430,361.10.   Also, according to a report released by the Debt Management Office of Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance in mid-2022, the loan was still in arrears at the end of 2021.

Then, on June 13, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed an RMB 1,070,000,000 (ETB 4,593,582,599 or $156 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Mekelle City Water Supply Project (captured via Project ID#60762). On the same day, China’s Ministry of Commerce and the Government of Ethiopia signed an RMB 540,000,000 (ETB 2,318,256,639) interest-free loan agreement for the Mekelle City Water Supply Project (captured via Project ID#66045). According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the GCL carries a 2% interest rate. However, the other borrowing terms of the GCL and the interest-free loan are unknown.  Ethiopia’s House of Representatives ratified both loan agreements on April 6, 2019. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the GCL and the interest-free loan to finance a commercial contract with the Government of Ethiopia and China Gezhouba Group Co. Ltd. (CGGC).   According to the Government of Ethiopia’s AMP, two disbursements took place in 2020: an ETB 274,488,122 disbursement on April 2, 2020, and an ETB 682,257,203 disbursement on September 1, 2020. However, it is unclear if these disbursements took place through the RMB 1,070,000,000 (ETB 4,593,582,599) China Eximbank loan, the RMB 540,000,000 (ETB 2,318,256,639) MOFCOM loan, or both loans.   This project involves the construction of the Gereb-Giba Dam on the Giba river and the installation of a water pipeline network to supply water to households, industrial parks and factories in and around the city of Mekelle (the capital of Ethiopia's northern Tigray regional state). Upon completion, the project is expected to meet the water needs of the estimated 400,000 residents of Mekelle. It is also expected to generate a maximum storage capacity of 363 million cubic meters during the rainy season, an annual water supply of 53.65 million cubic meters, and an average daily water supply of 124.43 thousand cubic meters. The project was also expected to create 1500 jobs for local people during the construction phase.   CGGC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on September 22, 2019. Then, on March 17, 2020, a river closure ceremony took place and dozens of heavy trucks poured dirt and stone into the Giba river. The Chinese Ambassador to Ethiopia, Mr. Tan Jian, and Mr. Debretsion, President of Tigray Regional State attended the closure ceremony, which marked the beginning of a new phase of the project (dam main body filling). Then, on November 11, 2020, after a violent conflict erupted between the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF) and the Government of Ethiopia, the Chinese Embassy in Ethiopia evacuated 600 Chinese workers (including CGGC workers assigned to the Mekelle City Water Supply Project) from Tigray State. The originally scheduled project completion date was March 1, 2023.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Mekelle City Water Supply Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs.

PRefChem owns and operates the Refinery and Petrochemical Complex, which forms a significant part of the Pengerang Integrated Complex (PIC) in Malaysia’s southern state of Johor. The refinery complex has a capacity of 300,000 barrels of crude oil per day, and it produces a range of refined petroleum products, including jet fuel, motor gasoline and diesel meeting Euro 5 fuel specifications. It also provides feedstock for the petrochemical complex, that has a nameplate capacity of 3.4 million metric tonne per annum (MTPA).  In March 2018, a syndicate of 19 banks — including Mizuho Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Standard Chartered, Bank of China, JP Morgan, SMBC, Mizuho, MUFJ, HSBC, CITI, and First Abu Dhabi Bank — signed an $8 billion bridge loan agreement with two borrowing institutions — Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Company Sdn Bhd — for Project Marigold in Malaysia. AidData estimates that BOC contributed $421,052,631 (captured via Project ID#89485) and ICBC also contributed $421,052,631 (captured via Project ID#89486) to this syndicated loan. The borrowing terms include an interest rate of LIBOR plus 40 basis points (0.40% margin) and a maturity length of 18 months. It was guaranteed by the debt service undertakings of the project sponsors, Petronas and Saudi Aramco. The proceeds from the bridge loan were to be used by the borrower to initiate construction while the borrowers finalized several long-term loan facilities with commercial banks and export credit agencies.  On November 5, 2019, Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Company Sdn Bhd signed five, long-term loan facilities (tranches) collectively worth $9.5 billion: (1) a $5.63 billion, 15.5 year uncovered facility provided by Ambank, ANZ, BNP Paribas, Bank of China, Credit Agricole, China Construction Bank, CIMB Bank, Citibank, HSBC, ICBC, JP Morgan, Maybank, Mizuho Bank, MUFG, National Bank of Kuwait, OCBC, Standard Chartered Bank, Societe Generale, SMBC and UOB; (2) a $1.5 billion JBIC/Nexi-covered tranche with Citibank, Mizuho, MUFG and SMBC; (3) a $789 million Kexim/K-Sure-covered tranche with ANZ, BNP Paribas, Bank of China, Credit Agricole, DZ Bank, JP Morgan, Mizuho Bank and National Bank of Kuwait; and (4) a $794 million SACE-covered tranche with Bank of China, BNP Paribas, DZ, HSBC and JP Morgan; and (5) an $800 million CESCE-covered tranche with Banco Santander, BNP Paribas, DZ Bank, HSBC, JP Morgan, Natixis and Societe Generale. Although these loans were issued to two borrowers (Pengerang Refining Company Sdn Bhd and Pengerang Petrochemical Sdn Bhd), there is a cross-guarantee and pari passu treatment.

The loan's amount outstanding was $17,083,525.57 (Rs. 2,206,265,577) as of December 31, 2013, $11,288,805.10 (Rs. 1,474,168,934) as of December 31, 2014, and $5,958,954.72 (Rs. 810,280,191) as of December 31, 2015.   The project involved an onshore component and an offshore component. The onshore component of the project involved 29 diesel and kerosene storage tanks and all the matching facilities. The offshore component of the project involved a one-point mooring system and a 5.6 km submarine oil transmission pipeline.   China Huanqiu Contracting & Engineering Corporation — a construction subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation specializing in the construction of refineries and chemical fertilizer plants connected to refineries, and mining plants — was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation.  Project implementation began on July 1, 2001 and ended on November 28, 2003 (two months ahead of schedule). The Muthurajawela tank farm became operational on May 27, 2004. With the construction of this tank farm, Sri Lanka’s storage capacity for finished petroleum products increased by 250,000 tonnes. Muthurajawela tank farm consists of 21 tanks of 10,000 m3 capacity and 8 tanks of 5,000 m3 capacity. These tanks store and distribute diesel and kerosene. Along with the tanks, CPC installed a new SPBM system, where 60,000 DWT (deadweight tonnage) ships could use the buoy for discharging imported finished products direct from sea to tanks via a submarine pipeline. This terminal includes a loading facility to distribute products by road tankers. However, rail transportation of petroleum products stored in the Muthurajawela tank farm is constrained due to the absence of a railway line. At the time of project completion, a dual pipeline transport systems named the ‘cross country pipeline’ with a length of 6.5 km was expected to link Muthurajawela tank farm with the Supugaskanda facility.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Government Agency",181046719.253758,"This project involved an onshore component and an offshore component.

38411,"China (People's Republic of)","Nepal","Asia",2016,2022,"China Eximbank provides RMB 1.02 billion government concessional loan for Pokhara International Regional Airport Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#71852)","In 1971, DIWI, a German consulting engineering firm, undertook the site selection work, detailed engineering work and a master plan for the construction of a regional international airport in Pokhara, a major tourism hub in Nepal. The work was performed for the Department of Civil Aviation with support from an Asian Development Bank (ADB) loan. Then, in 1975, the Government of Nepal acquired more than 3,106 ropanies of land for the project. A detailed project report was prepared in 1989 for Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), proposing a 2,500-meter-long runway with a terminal and cargo building. At that time, the airport was estimated to cost $39.6 million. Then, in 1993, a detailed engineering survey was conducted by the Department of Civil Aviation. During the mid-1990s Maoist insurgency, the hospitality sector in Pokhara almost collapsed and the airport construction project was halted.   The construction of the airport did not move forward until the tenure of Prime Minister Baburam Bhattarai in 2011. Talks between Chinese companies and Nepali politicians took place, led by Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun and Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation Post Bahadur Bogati. Then, on September 20, 2011, a  memorandum of understanding (MOU)  was signed, on the Government of Nepal’s behalf, by Barsha Man Pun, and Lui Shengcheng, Regional General Manager of China CAMC Engineering Co. Ltd. (CAMC), at the Ministry of Finance in Singha Durbar. The then energy minister Posta Bahadur Bogati and Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Yang Houlan also attended the signing ceremony. Following the signing of the MoU, Nepal’s Finance Ministry instructed the CAAN to invite bids for the construction of the regional airport. However, it later came to light that the Government of Nepal had committed to support CAMC’s bid to win the airport construction contract. This revelation occurred when Nepali Congress leader Deep Kumar Upadhyay circulated the MoU at a meeting of the parliamentary Public Accounts Committee (PAC), which later summoned Tourism Ministry and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN) officials over the controversy created by the short deadline given to bidders. The MoU specified that ‘the Government of Nepal shall provide CAMC solid and substantial support’ in the tender for an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract that that CAAN would issue for the construction of the regional international airport. Suspecting corruption, the PAC criticized Government of Nepal officials for allowing only a short deadline to the bidders. The Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), suspecting irregularities, also intervened, asking the Finance Ministry for more details about its interactions with CAMC. As the project became engulfed in controversy several hundred local protesters knocked on the doors of the government headquarters at Singha Durbar, demanding that the construction of the proposed regional international airport in Pokhara begin immediately. In the wake of the controversy, Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun said the Government of Nepal had scrapped all such MoUs.   Then, following intense pressure from political decision-makers, CAAN continued with the process and invited bids for the construction of the airport under an EPC plus financing (EPCF) model in February 2012, setting a very short deadline for the bidders. However, CIAA continued to intervene, delaying the process twice. CAAN's tender evaluation committee finally opened the financial proposals for the project in July 2012. At the time, Nepal’s Minister for Tourism and Civil Aviation Post Bahadur Bogati said that China Eximbank had offered a concessional loan for the project, but with a condition that it should be constructed by a company ‘recommended’ by the lenders. Three Chinese companies submitted proposals following the government’s invitation for bids. The Government of Nepal had estimated the project to cost $180 million, but the lowest bidder (CAMC) quoted a price of $305 million. Two other Chinese firms, Sinohydro Corporation and China International Water and Electric Corporation, quoted $337.82 million and $349.28 million, respectively. The airport project ran into controversy again, given that the lowest bid for its construction was substantially higher than the government’s estimated cost. Opposition over the construction and bidding process mounted. During a press event, former Minister for Civil Aviation and Tourism, and leader of the Nepali Congress, Deep Kumar Upadhaya, claimed that selection of CAMC for construction of the project involved massive irregularities. Several other politicians also alleged irregularities in the selection of the Chinese company without transparent competition. As opposition mounted, the ruling Maoists organized a series of protests and demonstrations in Pokhara.  In March 2014, the then Finance Minister, Ram Sharan Mahat said CAMC's bid of $305 million was ‘outrageous’ compared to another international airport being built with ADB funds—Gautam Buddha International Airport in Bhairahawa—and instructed the Civil Aviation Ministry to re-estimate the cost of building the airport. On April 7, 2014, at a CAAN board meeting chaired by Tourism Minister, Bhim Acharya approved the project with a revised cost of $215.96 million. The price tag had been recommended by a three-member independent panel formed by the government. Senior Government of Nepal officials that were involved in the negotiations said CAMC tried to convince them to accept the figure of $305 million, saying that the additional cost would be provided as a Chinese Government grant and that the Government of Nepal would incur no additional cost. CAMC later agreed to develop the airport at the Government of Nepal-estimated cost. Shortly thereafter, on May 22, 2014, CAAN and CAMC signed an RMB 1,541,017,825.57 ($244,040,450) commercial contract [No. 01/ATPDD/PRIA/2011/12] for the project.  Approximately two years later, on March 21, 2016, the Government of Nepal signed two loan agreements worth RMB 1,378,740,000 ($212,916,857) for the Pokhara International Regional Airport Construction Project: a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2016) 5 TOTAL NO. (1524)] with China Eximbank worth RMB 1,022,810,000 and an interest-free loan agreement with China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) worth RMB 355,930,000. The loan from China Eximbank, which is captured via Project ID#38411, carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 7 year grace period. The loan from MOFCOM, which is captured via Project ID#71852, carries the following borrowing terms: a 0% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a maturity of 20 years, and a grace period of 7 years.  The Government of Nepal used the loan proceeds to on-lend to CAAN at a 5% interest rate (with a 20 year maturity and 7 year grace period) through a Subsidiary Loan Agreement (SLA) that was finalized on June 5, 2016. The ultimate borrower (CAAN) was expected to use the loan proceeds to partially finance the RMB 1,541,017,825.57 ($244,040,450) commercial contract that it signed with CAMC on May 22, 2014.  Construction was delayed after China Eximbank set a condition that a joint escrow account should be set up into which CAAN — the project’s executing agency — would have to deposit the income generated from all of its airports. CAAN refused to do so, which delayed the release of the project funds, and construction of the airport stalled. However, CAAN and China Eximbank eventually agreed in 2017 to only deposit revenues generated by Pokhara International Regional Airport into the escrow account.    According the Nepali Ministry of Finance's Aid Management Information System, the China Eximbank loan had achieved a disbursement rate of 53.2% ($113,457,998 of $212,916,857) as of June 30, 2021. Individual disbursements included an $18,528,896 disbursement on April 1, 2018, a $10,280,341 disbursement on August 10, 2018, a $3,461,066 disbursement on December 11, 2018, a $8,737,899 disbursement on January 24, 2019, a $6,968,642 disbursement on July 14, 2019, a $49,806,492 disbursement on June 30, 2020, and a $15,674,663 disbursement on June 30, 2021. The loan's amount outstanding was RMB 827,963,224 ($127,959,211) as of July 15, 2021.  The Pokhara International Regional Airport Construction Project involved the construction of a 2,500 meter long and 45 meter wide airport that can accommodate medium category jets like the Boeing 757 and the Airbus 320. It also involved the construction of an apron, international and domestic terminal buildings, an air traffic control tower, a cargo terminal building along with an airport hangar. Upon completion, the project was expected to increase tourism in Pokhara, which is a scenic lake city in western Nepal and a major destinations for tourists. Once the international airport came into operation, tourists were expected to be able to fly directly to Pokhara. Prior to the implementation of the project, tourists had to first fly to Kathmandu and then take domestic flights or vehicles to travel to Pokhara. The project site is located in Chinnedanda, 3 km to the east of the existing domestic airport.    CAMC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Under the EPC contract, a single contractor takes responsibility for all components like design, engineering, construction and procurement. The contract binds the contractor to deliver the project at the stipulated time and at a predetermined price, regardless of any possible cost overruns. A letter to proceed with construction was issued to CAMC on July 11, 2017. CAMC then began implementation at the project site on November 1, 2017. The Government of Nepal, CAAN, and China Eximbank signed an implementation agreement [No. 2017SSYD001] on February 25, 2018. The first loan disbursement took place on April 1, 2018. An official project completion ceremony took place on or around March 31, 2022.   However, the project, which was originally expected to reach completion by July 10, 2021, faced various delays and challenges. Construction was delayed for months in early 2017 over an escrow account disagreement. China Eximbank insisted that an escrow account be opened into which CAAN would deposit the income generated from all its airports. However, the then Director General of CAAN, Sanjeev Gautam, refused to do so. After intense negotiations, China Eximbank issued a letter in April 2017, saying it had amended its earlier condition, allowing CAAN to deposit only those revenues generated by Pokhara International Airport into the escrow account. Gautam was later removed from office, and according to media reports, his ouster as CAAN Director General was a result of a ‘collusion’ between corrupt officials and business persons despite the risk of the government losing Rs. 6 billion over a dispute with an international contractor.  Covid-19 disruptions also stalled the procurement of materials and prevented workers from getting to the construction site in 2020 and 2021. Then, an audit report published by the Office of the Auditor General pointed out that due to lack of ‘technical preparation for the commercial operation of the new airport, it looks like Pokhara international airport will not come into operation immediately, even after the construction is completed.’  The audit report also said that CAAN would incur financial losses as a result of the project. Then, in January 2023, Dhananjay Regmi, chief executive officer of the Nepal Tourism Board, said ‘[w]e have now experienced that a lavish inauguration ceremony does not guarantee the regular operation of an airport. We have to be careful to ensure that the new international airport in Pokhara will not share the same fate as the one in Bhairahawa.’ [Note: Gautam Buddha International Airport in Bhairahawa, was only able to attract one foreign airline—Jazeera Airways—after it opened in May 2022.] Ashok Pokharel, president of the Nepal Association of Tour Operators, also said that ’[t]he fanfare has ended at both airports now. The government needs to be serious about how to operate them, or the failure of these mega projects could deal a severe blow to the economy. […].'  On January 1, 2023, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal attended an official inauguration ceremony to mark Pokhara International Regional Airport being put into operation.

Then, on October 11, 2009, Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) selected China Gezhouba Group Company Ltd (CGGC) as the project’s EPC contractor with a bidding amount of $89,231,692 (exclusive of VAT). A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) regarding the loan was signed by the Government of Nepal and the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank) on November 4, 2009. The MOU referenced $200 million: $120 million for the 60 MW Upper Trishuli 3A Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project and $80 million for other projects. An environmental impact assessment (EIA) report was approved by the Government of Nepal’s Ministry of Environment on August 26, 2010 and forwarded to China Eximbank on August 31, 2010. Then, on February 28, 2011, the Government of Nepal and China Eximbank signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2011) 9 TOTAL NO. (1399)] worth RMB 640 million (equivalent to approximately $90 million) for the 60 MW Upper Trishuli 3A Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: a 1.75% interest rate, a 25-year maturity, and a 5-year grace period. The Government of Nepal used the proceeds of the loan to develop an on-lending arrangement (through a ‘Subsidiary Loan Agreement’) with NEA on April 15, 2011.   The loan agreement went into effect on June 1, 2011. However, the scope of the project was subsequently expanded and the face value of the loan was increased to $149,378,539. The loan achieved a disbursement rate of at least 66.3% ($99,047,167 out of $149,378,539), with 58 disbursements taking place between June 2011 and June 2021. The loan's amount outstanding was RMB 537,862,139 ($83,124,966) as of July 15, 2021. NEA (the ultimate borrower) was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance a commercial (EPC) contract that it signed with China Gezhouba Group Co. Ltd. (CGGC) on May 31, 2010.   The Upper Trishuli 3A hydroelectric power plant project involved the construction of a 60 MW run-of-river (ROR) plant with annual energy generation of 460 GWh. More specifically, it involved the installation of a 25 meter high diversion weir, intake, desander, 4.1 km headrace tunnel, surge shaft, inclined shaft, underground powerhouse, tailrace, switchyard, 48 km long 220 Kv transmission line, and a 4 circuit 1 km 220 Kv underground cabling and ancillary structure. The power plant is located near Simle village within Kispang Rural Municipality on the borders of the Rasuwa and Nuwakot districts. CGGC was the EPC contractor responsible for all civil, electro-mechanical, and hydro-mechanical works, including gradation of the 11.5 km long access road, construction of a steel bridge over Trishuli River, construction of temporary camp at headworks, and excavation of Adit no. 1 and head pond excavation. Northwest Engineering Corporation Limited (previously known as Northwest HydroConsulting Engineers) was selected as the contractor responsible for construction supervision. It was issued a supervision contract worth $4,443,926 on June 29, 2010. CGGC received a ‘Commencement of Work Order’ on June 1, 2011.   The project was initiated on November 23, 2011 and it encountered various delays due to disputes over whether to build powerhouse underground or overground, disputes about whether to increase the capacity of the project, damages to the access roads leading to the project site (resulting from landslides that were triggered by an April 2015 earthquake), and a blockade imposed by India. On May 26, 2019, the first unit of the plant was successfully connected to the grid. The second unit was successfully connected to the grid later in 2019. The hydroelectric power plant was officially completed and inaugurated on November 18, 2019. The electricity that is now generated by the plant mainly serves people in Kathmandu and it reportedly fulfills seven percent of the country’s total electricity demand.","Completion","Development","Loan","ODA-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Government Agency",183717704.633815,"The 60 MW Upper Trishuli 3A Hydroelectric Power Plant is located near Simle village within Kispang Rural Municipality on the borders of the Rasuwa and Nuwakot districts.

Then, on April 23, 2021, Dhaka Bypass Expressway Development Company Limited signed a $184.3 million (BDT 16.14 billion) syndicated overseas loan agreement with China Development Bank (CDB) and China CITIC Bank for the Joydevpur–Debogram–Bhulta–Madanpur Road Upgrading Project. On behalf of their respective loan syndicates, CDB and Bangladesh Infrastructure Finance Fund Limited signed a Common Terms Agreement. It is known that these loans carry 18-year maturities, but their interest rates and grace periods are unknown.   The Asian Development Bank (ADB) also issued a $100 million loan (ID#3958-BAN) on September 10, 2010 to Bangladesh Infrastructure Finance Fund Limited, which it appears to have on-lent to the Dhaka Bypass Expressway Development Company Limited (before the syndicated loans were issued).   The total cost of the Joydevpur–Debogram–Bhulta–Madanpur Road Upgrading Project is $412.2275 million (RMB 2.844 billion). It is being implemented on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30. Dhaka Bypass Expressway Development Company Limited signed a concession agreement with Bangladesh's Roads and Highways Department (RHD) on December 6, 2018. This agreement made Dhaka Bypass Expressway Development Company Limited responsible for designing, financing, constructing, operating, and maintaining the tolled expressway over a 25-year concession period, with tolls charged based on vehicle type. The Government of Bangladesh provided viability gap funding of BDT 3.1 billion and a minimum revenue guarantee to the concessionaire. The concession agreement also grants the Government of Bangladesh a share of the revenues generated by Dhaka Bypass Expressway Development Company Limited over a certain threshold.  The purpose of the project is to upgrade the 48 km Joydevpur–Debogram–Bhulta–Madanpur Road to a dual carriageway to improve connectivity between country's north and northwest with Chattogram Port. More specifically, the project will seek to add a four-lane tollway and a two-lane service to the Joydevpur–Debogram–Bhulta–Madanpur Road (National Highway N105). The project’s ultimate aim is to create a key connection between the industrial zone northeast of Dhaka and national highway N1 to Chattogram, as well as to the N2, N3, and N4 national highways. Due to heavy traffic concerns, it is hoped that this project will reduce journey times and address traffic issues. Upon completion, the Joydevpur–Debogram–Bhulta–Madanpur Road will become Bangladesh's first toll road. Construction was originally expected to commence in September 2019.  A foundation stone laying ceremony took place on December 26, 2019, and at that time, the project was expected to reach completion in 2022. However, the project hit several snags. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic led to major implementation delays. A 2017 land acquisition law also increased the amount of financial compensation needed to pay affected people considerably, which led to land acquisition delays. Construction ultimately began in October 2020. However, by June 2021, RHD had already requested an extension to the project completion deadline to June 2024.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Commercial Bank|State-owned Policy Bank","Recipient Private Sector|Chinese Private Sector|Recipient Private Sector",184300000,"The purpose of the project is to to upgrade the 48 km Joydevpur–Debogram–Bhulta–Madanpur Road to a dual carriageway to improve connectivity between country's north and northwest with Chattogram Port.

The Ethiopian Government provided a sovereign guarantee for this loan. The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: an interest rate of 6 month LIBOR plus a 2.35% margin, a 3 year grace period, and a 12 year maturity.   On June 1, 2011, China Eximbank and the ESC also signed a $123,000,000 (ETB 2,077,702,703) loan agreement for the Kessem Sugar Factory Project (captured via Project ID#30113). The borrowing terms of this loan were as follows: an interest rate of 6 month LIBOR plus a 2.35% margin, a 3 year grace period, and a 12 year maturity. The Ethiopian Government provided a sovereign guarantee for this loan.  The borrower was initially expected to use the CDB and China Eximbank loan proceeds to finance a commercial contract between the ESC and the Ethiopian state-owned Metals & Engineering Corporation (MetEC), which was signed in March 2011. However, in 2012, the Government of Ethiopia dismissed MetEC and re-issued the commercial contract to China National Complete Plant Import-Export Corporation (COMPLANT).   According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the ETB 2,533,783,784 loan achieved a 43.8% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making a single disbursement of ETB 911,906,704 on July 7, 2013.  According to the Government of Ethiopia’s AMP, the ETB 2,077,702,703 loan achieved a 110% disbursement rate, with CDB making 6 loan disbursements (worth ETB 2,283,941,874) between 2012 and 2014: an ETB 387,188,627 disbursement on June 29, 2012, an ETB 261,859,928 disbursement on October 18, 2012, an ETB 215,748,901 disbursement on January 11, 2013, an ETB 417,546,480 disbursement on June 6, 2013, an ETB 484,171,322 disbursement on June 18, 2013, and an ETB 517,426,615 disbursement on April 30, 2014.  The purpose of the project was to construct the Kessem sugar factory, which is located in Zone Three of the Awash Fentallie and Dulecha districts of Afar Regional State. The factory has a total of 20,000 hectares of land to be cultivated with cane & its plantation stretches to the areas known as Kessem and Bolhomon. The Kessem Dam, which has a capacity of holding 500 cubic meters water, is the source from which sugarcane cultivation was to be carried out.    COMPLANT was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation.   Construction began in May 2012 and ended on November 30, 2014.  Irrigable land reached 2,946 hectares while the construction of 20.5 kilometers of main canal was completed. Then, in March 2015, the factory underwent a trial run. Factory operations began in 2016. However, according to the AMP, the project had only achieved a 99.05% completion rate as of April 2022. Currently, the sugar factory has 8,413 hectares of land covered with cane among which 6,000 hectares cultivated by a private company known as Amibara Agricultural Development (with which ESC has signed contractual agreement). Kessem Sugar Factory is capable of producing 260,000 tons of sugar and 30,000 cube meters of ethanol per year at maximum capacity.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank and CDBs loan for the Kessem Sugar Factory Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lenders. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs.

The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: 20 year maturity, 5 year grace period, 2% interest rate, and 0.3% management fee. The final maturity date of the loan is September 21, 2026. The GCL that was signed on May 11, 2006 is captured in Project ID#49079. The GCL that was signed on January 15, 2007 is captured in Project ID#49078.   The proceeds of both GCLs were to be used to be the borrower to finance a commercial contract between the Philippines' Bureau of Customs and Nuctech Company Limited. The purpose of the NCISP was to purchase and install x-ray scanners for use in the country’s major customs collection districts, including the Port of Manila, Manila International Container Port, Port of Subic, Port of Clark, Port of Batangas, Port of Cebu, Port of Davao, Port of Cagayan de Oro, Sub-Port of General Santos, Port of Zamboanga. Each of these scanners was capable of inspecting at least 20 forty-foot containers or 17 forty-foot containers per hour.   The objectives of the project included improving accuracy and correctness of assessment and collection of duties and taxes; combatting smuggling and the illegal entry of drugs and hazardous materials; and improving the inflow and outflow of containers through the country’s ports. Phase 1 supported the acquisition and installation of 10 x-ray scanners for use in the country’s major customs collection districts. Phase 2 supported the acquisition and installation of 20 x-ray scanners. Under Phase 2, three scanners each were earmarked for use in the South Harbor Port and the Manila International Container Port; two scanners were earmarked for use at the NAIA airport; and one scanner each was earmarked for use in the Cebu City, Subic, Clark, Batangas, San Fernando, Legaspi, Iloilo, Tacloban, Surigao, Cagayan de Oro, Zamboanga and Davao Ports.   Nuctech Company Limited was the contractor responsible for the implementation of both phases, and its work was overseen by the Philippines' Bureau of Customs. After President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed Executive Order No. 592 on December 16, 2006 and imposed the mandatory payment of a Container Security Fee to support the NCISP, Commissioner Morales issued Customs Memorandum Order No. 6-2007 on March 28, 2007 and created an x-ray committee to carry out effectively the mandate of the Project. CMO No. 6-2007 enumerated guidelines for the conduct of x-ray inspection on containerized shipments and established an X-Ray Inspection Project (XIP) as a specialized and technical unit that would oversee the administrative and operational control of all x-ray scanning equipment. This container inspection system was put into effect in July 2007 and it reportedly led to a reduction in the number of shipments subjected to actual physical inspection (due to the fact that the scanners clearly demonstrated which cargoes needed to be examined physically).   However, this project was also plagued by controversy due to allegations of artificially inflated costs. In 2016, the Philippines’ Commission on Audit (COA) asked the Bureau of Customs (BOC) to review the 2006 commercial contract with Nuctech Company Limited and the China Eximbank loan agreements that were used to finance the commercial contract (after COA found that the mobile X-ray machines purchased in 2006 were exorbitantly overpriced’ (by PHP 4.215 billion). The Government of the Philippines paid PHP 7.953 billion to Nuctech Company Limited for 30 units of mobile X-ray equipment. But when COA asked for a quotation from another international supplier of non-intrusive container inspection scanners, it found that the Government of the Philippines could have purchased the X-ray machines at a lower price for even better performance. COA's quotation from the said supplier showed that an X-ray machine ‘with vastly superior performance’ would only cost PHP 124.6 million each, for a total of PHP 3.738 billion for thirty units. A special COA audit noted that these x-ray machines could ‘be utilized at sea ports that can scan trucks and containers five times the speed of the mobile X-rays that BOC have’.  Aside from overpriced nature of the x-ray machines, the COA audit found that the maintenance cost of the X-ray machines from Nuctech Company Limited was substantially higher (by PHP 3.264 million) compared to other suppliers.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRADE POLICIES AND REGULATIONS",NA,"State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Government Agency",189241467.49462,"The purpose of this project was to purchase and install 20 x-ray scanners for use in the country’s ports of entry. 3 scanners each were earmarked for use in the South Harbor Port and the Manila International Container Port; two scanners were earmarked for use at the NAIA airport; and one scanner each was earmarked for use in the Cebu City, Subic, Clark, Batangas, San Fernando, Legaspi, Iloilo, Tacloban, Surigao, Cagayan de Oro, Zamboanga and Davao Ports.

The other borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, is is known that SPC used the deferred payment arrangement to finance a $110 million commercial (EPC) contract that it signed with China Harbour Engineering Co. Ltd on June 8, 2006.  The purpose of the project was to construct two 70,000-ton (TEU) container terminals at Port Sudan (Berths 17 and 18). The total length of the terminals is 781 meters with a water depth of 16 meters. The project scope also included dredging activities (for a foundation trench, turning basin, main channel) with a total volume of 3.5 million cubic meters.

However, the deferred payment (lending) arrangement between SPC and CHEC appears to have underperformed vis-à-vis the original expectations of CHEC. Sudan’s Ministry of Finance initially set up a special bank account into which SPC deposited its monthly operating income (worth approximately $200 million a year), and SPC was allowed to retain some but not all of these funds for its own purposes (such as construction and maintenance of port facilities and servicing its debts to CHEC). However, Sudan’s Ministry of Finance subsequently took away SPC’s ability to retain a portion of its monthly income around 2011 (when the Sudanese Government faced an acute foreign exchange shortage), which made it substantially more difficult for SPC to honor its monthly repayment obligations.

Then, on December 16, 2011, CDB signed two bilateral facility (loan) agreements with KAZ Minerals Aktogay Finance Limited — a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of KAZ Minerals Aktogay LLP, which is itself a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kazykhmys PLC (Kaz Minerals PLC) — for the Aktogay Copper Mine Development Project: an RMB 1 billion ($158 million) loan agreement (as captured via Project ID#39557) and a $1.34 billion loan agreement (as captured via Project ID#41941). The RMB 1 billion loan tranche (facility) and the $1.34 billion loan tranche (facility) were available to the borrower for draw down over a three year period. The maturity of each loan was 15 years from the date of first draw down and the grace period of each loan was 3 years. The interest rate for the USD-denominated loan tranche was LIBOR plus a 4.20% margin and the interest rate for the RMB-denominated loan tranche was based on the applicable benchmark lending rate published by the People's Bank of China (PBoC). KAZ Minerals PLC provided a guarantee for both loans. As an additional credit enhancement, the borrower pledged a $100,000,000 minimum cash balance in a charge account (collection account) as a source of collateral.  As of December 31, 2015, the RMB facility was fully drawn down (disbursed). To protect against currency risks, KAZ Minerals swapped the interest basis from a RMB interest rate into a USD LIBOR interest basis. As of December 31, 2016, the USD facility was fully drawn down. Arrangement fees with an amortized cost of $15 million, were netted off against these borrowings in accordance with IAS 39. The USD facility was repayable in half-yearly installments beginning in March 2018.  The 2016 audited KAZ Minerals financial report identified the interest rates of the USD-denominated and RMB-denominated loan tranches as 5.12% and 4.33% (as of December 31, 2016) and 5.12% and 3.93% (as December 31, 2015), respectively. The 2017 report identified the interest rates of the USD-denominated and RMB-denominated loan tranches as 5.60% and 4.54% (as of December 31, 2017) respectively. AidData has used this information to estimate the interest rates that apply to these loans.    The initial development cost of the copper mine was $2 billion, with KAZ Minerals seeking to fund the remaining $500 million. The mine was eventually expected to produce up to 100,000 tons of copper concentrate annually beginning in 2015. The project was comprised of an open-pit mine and an on-site concentrator to produce copper cathode from oxide ore and copper concentrate from the sulphide ore, with molybdenum as a by-product. Alarko was the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor responsible for the processing plant at Aktogay. BIR provided engineering and consultancy services for architectural, civil, mechanical and electrical works for the project. ABB provided complete electrification and automation solutions and three gearless mill drive systems, while Ausenco was contracted to work on the open-pit mine.

The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity (final maturity date: 2032), a 5 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0.5% management fee, and a 0.5% commitment fee. To facilitate loan repayment, the GCL agreement specifies that the borrower must deposit the proceeds from the revenue generated by Victoria Falls Airport and the passenger service charges generated from Harare Airport in an escrow account held by China Eximbank.     This project involved an extension of an existing runway, the construction of a second 4,000 meter long runway, the construction of a 20,000 square meter new terminal, and the construction of a parking lot. Upon completion, it was expected that Victoria Falls International Airport would be able to handle 1.2 million passengers a year and accommodate wide-bodied aircrafts such as 747s.   China Jiangsu International was the contractor responsible for implementation, and its work was overseen by the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe. On April 12, 2013, construction began. The project was originally expected to take 30 months to complete (October 12, 2015). The project was completed and officially handed over to the Zimbabwean authorities on November 18, 2016.     However, there are signs that the China Eximbank loan contracted by the Government of Zimbabwe for the Victoria Falls Airport Renovation and Expansion Project has underperformed financially. As of 2018, the borrower had accumulated principal and interest arrears and penalties worth $12,715,177.30. Also, according to a report released by the Debt Management Office of Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance in mid-2022, the loan was still in arrears at the end of 2021.

(2015) 22 TOTAL NO. (365)] with China Eximbank for the Sam Lord's Castle Hotel Reconstruction Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC (loan) were as follows: a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, an interest rate of 2.5%, a default (penalty) interest rate of 0%, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% ($425,000) management fee. The borrower was expected to make semi-annual repayments between January 21, 2022 and January 31, 2037. The borrower was also required under the terms of the loan agreement to deposit foreign currency in an escrow account that is accessible to the lender (China Eximbank).   The proceeds of the loan were on-lent from the Government of Barbados’ Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs to the Barbados Tourism Investment Inc. The ‘end-user’ (Barbados Tourism Investment Inc.) then used the loan proceeds to finance 85% of the total cost of a $200 million commercial contract that it signed with China National Complete Plant Import & Export Corporation (中成进出口股份有限公司巴巴多斯分公司 or COMPLANT) on November 13, 2014.   The loan's (principal) amount outstanding was BBD 68,000,000 as of December 31, 2017, BBD 83,818,262 as of December 31, 2018, BBD 116,222,664 as of December 31, 2019, and BBD 323,647,085 as of December 31, 2022.  The purpose of the project is to reconstruct the Wyndham Luxury resort at the Sam Lord's Castle in Saint Phillip's Parish (in Chinese: 山姆罗德酒店). The resort was expected to add 450 rooms to the island's room stock and to employ over 1,000 people.   China National Complete Plant Import & Export Corporation is the contractor responsible for project implementation.   A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on November 23, 2015. However, construction did not begin until June 2016. The project was originally expected to take three years to complete. However, project implementation ‘stalled’ in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic led to additional implementation delays in 2020. In July 2021, COMPLANT brought close to 200 Chinese workers to the project site.  However, local contractors expressed concern, pointing out that Barbadian companies were being pushed out in favor of the lower-wage Chinese laborers. One local contractor claimed that COMPLANT was constantly trying to get them to reduce their rates to levels which were not sustainable. The same contractor complained about a shortage of bathroom facilities on the job site — for both the local and Chinese workers. At the time, Stuart Layne, CEO of the Barbados Tourism Investment Inc., said they were still maintaining the 60/40 agreement ratio, with local contractors getting 40 percent of the work at the project site.  On June 1, 2018, the Government of Barbados announced a selective default and requested IMF balance of payments support. The timing of the announcement was partly driven by large external debt payments that were due in early June 2018, and the Government of Barbados defaulted on these partly with the aim of preserving foreign exchange reserves. However, the Government of Barbados honored its repayment obligations to China Eximbank under the PBC for the Sam Lord's Castle Hotel Reconstruction Project. As of 2020, Government of Barbados was unable to meet its $30 million counterpart funding contribution to the $200 million project and actively seeking to sell the hotel asset (upon completion of its construction).

The PBC originally carried a maturity of 15 years and a grace period of 6 years. Its interest rate is unknown.   Joint Stock Company ""Savings Bank"" Belarusbank (JSC JSSB Belarusbank) is the agent bank responsible for servicing the PBC. The proceeds of the CDB loan (captured via Project ID#66959) and the China Eximbank PBC (captured via Project ID#66961) were to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract with China CAMC Engineering Co., Ltd. (CAMCE).  The purpose of the project was to construct the infrastructure of the Great Stone Industrial Park (also known as the China-Belarus Industrial Park or Індустрыяльны парк «Вялікі камень» or Индустриальный парк «Великий камень»), which is located in the Smolevichi district between the Petrovichi reservoir and Minsk National Airport (25 km to the east of the capital city of Minsk). It involved the construction of 13 km of two-way, six lane roads inside the park; the installation of water supply, drainage, power supply, gas supply, communications systems; the construction of office buildings, warehouses, and factories; and the construction of a 110 kV transformer substation, six 10 kV distributions, 90 km power supply lines, one water supply plant, one rainwater treatment plant, one water intake station, and one secondary lift pump station. The park was designed to attract global high-tech enterprises with a focus on electronics, biomedicine, and engineering.     CAMCE — a subsidiary of Sinomach — was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by CJSC “Industrial Park Development Company”.  The construction of the park, which was modeled on the China-Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park, began on June 19, 2014. Then, on May 12, 2015, Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan inspected the project site in the company of H.E. Belarusian President Lukashenko. Construction, which was originally scheduled for completion in 2018, was completed on or around October 16, 2017.   CJSC “Industrial Park Development Company” was founded on August 27, 2012 and it is jointly owned by Sinomach (32%), CAMCE (13.71%), China Merchants Group (20%), Harbin Investment Group (2.29%), and the Government of Belarus (32%). Its creation followed the signing of an intergovernmental agreement on the China-Belarus Industrial Park on September 18, 2011 and the subsequent ratification of the agreement by both countries on January 30, 2012. Then, on June 5, 2012, a special legal, regulatory, customs and tax regime was granted to businesses operating within the China-Belarus Industrial Park, providing favorable terms for resident businesses and investors.  By the end of 2014, only two companies —  affiliates of HUAWEI and ZTE — were operating in the industrial park. However, by May 2017, 13 companies were operating in the park and 10 additional companies — from China, Belarus, Russia, Austria, the USA and Lithuania — began operating in the park by the end of 2017. Then, in May 2017, the first stage of the China‑Belarus Commerce & Logistics Park was commissioned. About $120 million was invested in the construction of this logistics subpark with a total area of 100,000 m2. During the first quarter of 2018, Duisburger Hafen AG (duisport) acquired a 1% stake in CBIPDC, and as part of the transaction, a rail terminal (including a logistics area) was to be built, led by duisport, as well as China Merchants China‑Belarus, the Belarus state‑owned railway and Hupac Intermodal (Swiss), Europe’s leading intermodal (and green logistics) provider. As of August 2018, there were 36 companies were operating in the park (20 from China and 16 from Austria, Belarus, Germany, Israel, Lithuania, Russia, and the USA). By July 2019, there were 44 companies operating in park.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan (PBC) for the Great Stone Industrial Park Construction Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. The lender extended the loan's grace period by an additional year in November 2020 (as captured via Project ID#96419). The Government of Belarus showed signs of financial distress before and after the grace period extension was offered. In 2019, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported that international reserves had fallen 'well below adequacy metrics', covering a mere 2 months of imports. On December 16, 2019, China Development Bank stepped into the breach and issued an RMB 3.5 billion ($500 million) emergency loan to Ministry of Finance of Belarus. It explicitly authorized the borrower to use the proceeds of the loan to repay existing debts and shore up the country's foreign exchange reserves. Then, on July 14, 2022, the Government of Belarus defaulted on its USD-denominated Eurobond payment. As of April 2023, it was attempting to meet its Eurobond payment obligations in local currency, in contravention of bond documentation that does not allow for settlement in alternative currencies.

[…] EDL’s debt service obligations [were] still unsustainable [at the time], with future debt service accounting for about two fifths of EDL’s total operating revenue.’ The Laotian authorities sought and secured debt service payment deferrals from their Chinese creditors in 2020 and 2021; according to the World Bank, ‘[d]ebt service deferrals granted by major lenders in 2020-2021 amounted around 3.6 percent of GDP in 2021’ and ’[a]s a result, actual debt service payments are estimated to have declined to 48 percent of total revenues in 2021, compared to 65 percent in the 2021 [Government of Laos] plan.’  The country’s central bank (Bank of the Lao P.D.R) also made a $300 million drawdown under its currency swap agreement with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in June 2020 — when its gross reserves stood at only 1.5 months of import cover and credit rating agencies warned of a high default probability. Then, in 2021, the short-term emergency loan from the PBOC was ‘rolled over’ for another year. Around the same time, a Chinese state-owned enterprise purchased a major public infrastructure asset in Laos—a large part of the country’s electricity transmission grid—from EDL as part of an apparent debt-for-equity swap. China Southern Power Grid Co. and EDL established a joint venture known as Électricité du Laos Transmission Company Limited (EDLT) in September 2020.  China Southern Power Grid Co. purchased a 90% ownership stake in EDLT in exchange for a $600 million fee (equity infusion). Then, in March 2021, EDLT signed a 25-year concession agreement, which made it responsible for management of the country’s high-voltage transmission network above 230 kilovolts. Independent observers suggested at the time that EDL would likely use the $600 million upfront payment from China Southern Power Grid Co. to service its outstanding debts to Chinese creditors, although this has not been independently confirmed. According to the World Bank’s International Debt Statistics, the Government of Laos was responsible for making average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $232 million between 2019 and 2019 and average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $60 million between 2020 and 2021 (a substantially lower figure due to payment deferrals); however, it expected to make average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth nearly $678 million over the next seven years (2022-2028).","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company",191703611.931997,"The purpose of the project was to construct 1 new substation, extend two existing substations, and construct a a 90-kilometer dual-circuit transmission line from Hinheup (Hin Heup) substation to Nabong substation via Nam Ngum 1 Substation.

This project involved the construction of a 1,768 km oil pipeline from the Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli oil field in the Caspian Sea to the Ceylon Terminal located on the Turkish coast of the Mediterranean Sea. This pipeline passes through Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey. From the Ceyhan Terminal, the oil is distributed to international markets.   The Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline Company was established in London on August 1, 2002. A ceremony launching construction of the pipeline was held on September 18, 2002. Construction began in April 2003 and was completed in 2005. The Azerbaijan section was constructed by Consolidated Contractors International of Greece, and Georgia's section was constructed by a joint venture of France's Spie Capag and UK Petrofac International. The Turkish section was constructed by BOTAŞ Petroleum Pipeline Corporation. Bechtel was the main contractor for engineering, procurement, and construction. On May 25, 2005, the pipeline was inaugurated at the Sangachal Terminal by President Ilham Aliyev of the Azerbaijan Republic, President Mikhail Saakashvili of Georgia, and President Ahmet Sezer of Turkey, joined by President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan and United States Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman.  The inauguration of the Georgian section was hosted by President Mikheil Saakashvili at the pumping station near Gardabani on October 12, 2005. The inauguration ceremony at Ceyhan terminal was held on July 13, 2006. The pipeline was gradually filled with 10 million barrels of oil flowing from Baku and reaching Ceyhan on May 28, 2006. The first oil was loaded at the Ceyhan Marine Terminal (Haydar Aliyev Terminal) onto a tanker named British Hawthorn. The tanker sailed on June 4, 2006, with about 600,000 barrels (95,000 m3) of crude oil.

The loan carries a 15-year maturity. The other borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the Ministry of Finance of Bangladesh issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan on December 23, 2020 and a Sinosure credit insurance policy went into effect on October 27, 2021. It is also known that this $557.89 million independent power plant (IPP) project is being financed according to a 70:30 debt-to-equity ratio.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 350-megawatt (MW) coal-fired power station in the Nishanbaria village of Taltali upazila within Barguna district and Barisal division.   Shanghai Electric Power Construction Company Limited (SEPC) was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Satellite imagery demonstrates that preliminary construction activities began between January 2019 and November 2019. Construction of a 217-meter chimney started on December 16, 2020. Then, in February 2022, the lifting of the steel inner tube of the chimney was completed, marking the completion of the main chimney at the power plant. The power plant’s 400kV electricity transmission line was completed on May 19, 2022. The power plant was connected to the national grid on October 29, 2022. The power plant was originally scheduled to reach its commercial operation date (COD) on January 12, 2022. It passed its 168-hour reliability test and began commercial operations on December 31, 2022. Satellite imagery from December 2022 revealed a plume at the project site.   The project became a source of local controversy and public opposition. On August 2, 2018, villagers submitted a public petition to the Prime Minister urging the government to stop the project, alleging that BEPCL was purchasing lands with the help of illegal brokers with forged documents. In October 2018, the government said it would investigate the claims. In February 2019, Transparency International Bangladesh again called on the government to halt the plant's construction, claiming that the project had no approval from Bangladesh's Department of Environment — as well as claiming that local residents who have filed claims for compensation over land acquisition have been threatened and even assaulted. A study conducted by civil society organization the Bangladesh Working Group on External Debt (BWGED) says 153 families were directly impacted by the construction of the coal power plant. Of them, 142 were reportedly evicted by force. The BWGED study also noted that, when operational, the power station would emit 7,081 tonnes of carbon a day and damage several rich ecological zones nearby, including Tengragiri Wildlife Sanctuary, Sonakata Eco Park, Laldia mangrove forest, and Fatrar Char mangrove forest. It also raised the fear that hot water released from the plant into the Payra river would have negative effects on the hilsa population. Barges carrying coal to the plant will also reportedly move through a hilsa breeding ground. Hilsa is not only the favorite fish of Bangladesh but also a major revenue earner through exports.

According to official correspondence between the Concessional Loan Department of China Eximbank and the State Minister of Finance of Ethiopia (on December 25, 2019), China Eximbank made an initial loan disbursement worth $37,015,814.73 (as part of an advance payment and progress payment) on December 25, 2019. This overall loan disbursement rate was of December 25, 2019 was 21.6%. As of April 2022, no additional loan disbursements were recorded in the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP).

The project is specifically tied to an effort to develop a flagship industrial park in the city of Hawassa called the Hawassa Industrial Park (HIP).   The Modjo Hawassa Highway Construction Project is being financed and implemented in 4 lots. Lot 1 is a 57 km Modjo-Meki section of the highway that is being financed by the African Development Bank and the Government of Ethiopia (and implemented by CREC).

Under the terms of the ‘resources-for-infrastructure’ agreement, TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC agreed to ‘front’ $179 million for the construction of Phase 1 by borrowing directly from China Eximbank, and, in turn, the Tajik Government agreed to grant TBEA exclusive rights to explore and develop gold deposits at the Eastern Duoba mine and the Upper Kumarg mine (until TBEA could recoup its investment). The Tajik Government also reportedly agreed to give TBEA the rights to further mining deposits (at an unidentified location) if the profit made from the gold deposits at the Eastern Duoba mine and the Upper Kumarg mine did not cover the cost of Phase 1 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. Also, as part of the ‘resources-for-infrastructure’ agreement, TBEA was reportedly exempted from paying customs duties and value added tax (VAT) on imported equipment necessary for exploration and development of the deposits. The tax and customs exemptions were scheduled to cease once TBEA recouped its initial costs. However, the agreement allowed TBEA to continue to mine the gold deposits for profit after the expiration of the exemptions.   Then, on November 7, 2014, the the Government of Tajikistan and the Export-Import Bank of China signed two loan agreements — a RMB 929,977,078 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2014) 30 TOTAL NO. (553)] and a $178,969,220 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2014) 40 TOTAL NO. (34)] for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. The GCL is captured via Project ID#46211 and the PBC is captured via Project ID#71137. Both of these loans were ratified by the Tajik Parliament on January 14, 2015. The GCL was contracted by the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and it carried the following borrowing terms: a 25 year maturity, an 11 year grace period, and a 1.5% interest rate. The PBC carries a 20 year maturity, a 9 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The Government of Tajikistan contributed $17,443,400 of counterpart financing. In total, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan contracted $331,058,220 of China Eximbank debt for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. The Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds of the GCL and the PBC to on-lend to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) “Barqi Tojik”. OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” was a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy. The subsidiary GCL agreement (#TАJ 2014-028-2) was signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” on December 18, 2014. It carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 25 years. Its final maturity date was set to August 21, 2039. The subsidiary PBC agreement (#TАJ 2014-028-1) was also signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” on December 18, 2014 and it carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 20 years. Its final maturity date was set to June 21, 2034.   The PBC’s amount outstanding was TJS 808,004,000 as of December 31, 2016, TJS 1,343,913,000 as of December 31, 2017, TJS 1,436,962,000 as of December 31, 2018, TJS 1,476,217,000 as of December 31, 2019, and TJS 2,022,352,000 as of December 31, 2020. The GCL’s amount outstanding was TJS 1,054,408,000 as of December 31, 2016, TJS 1,259,654,000 as of December 31, 2017, TJS 1,274,255,000 as of December 31, 2018, TJS 1,288,762,000 as of December 31, 2019, and TJS 1,610,069,000 as of December 31, 2020.  Dushanbe 2 is a combined heat and power plant (CHP) — also known as the Dushanbe-2 Thermal Power Plant (TPS-2) — that provides heat and electricity for the residents of Dushanbe. It only operates in the winter. The 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project was designed and implemented in two phases. The power plant was to be fueled by coal, with the potential to switch to gas. Phase 1 (mainly constructed between 2012-2014) installed a capacity of 100 MW, while Phase 2 (constructed between 2014-2016) installed an additional capacity of 300 MW. TBEA was the general contractor responsible for implementation of both phases. Henan No 1 Thermal Power Construction Company was also involved in the implementation of Phase 1. Inner Mongolia Electric Power Survey and Design Institute Co., Ltd. was the contractor responsible for the design for Phase 2. Hydro Electric Power System Engineering Company was also involved in the implementation of Phase 2.   Phase 1 was originally scheduled to be completed and put into production before the celebration of the 20th anniversary of Tajik independence in 2011 (on September 9, 2011), and the second phase was scheduled to be completed in 2013. A formal groundbreaking ceremony for Phase 1 took place on September 8, 2009. However, construction did not begin until November 2012. Phase 1 was completed on September 13, 2014 and the first two (50MW) power generation units were put into operation on November 10, 2014. Phase 2 began on May 14, 2015 and was completed on December 8, 2016. According to President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon as relayed by TBEA, the power plant generates 9.6 million kWh power per day and 235 trillion Kcal heat, and it provides nearly 700 stable jobs to Tajiks. The electricity generated from the power plant is sold to Barki Tojik Open Stock Holding Power under a power purchase agreement. Through this project, 150 Tajik technicians went to China for training, and about 100 Tajik operators received professional know-how from Chinese experts. According to Xinhua, the completed power plant met 60 percent of the power demand and restarted the provision of central heating to more than 700,000 Dushanbe residents after 15 years of suspension. The completion of the power plant was declared to be a solution to Tajikistan's long-existing issue of power shortages during the winter.   However, it appears that the project’s second phase has encountered revenue generation and loan repayment problems. In 2018, the Government of Tajikistan reportedly granted a gold mining license to TBEA as ‘remuneration’ for Phase 2. Media reports indicate that TBEA agreed to work on the gold deposits as long as it takes to recoup the costs that it incurred during the construction of Phase 2. Several years later, in November 2021, TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC reported that it had completed half of the work on the construction of the gold processing plant and ancillary facilities in Ayni district of the northern province of Sughd, Tajikistan. The purpose of these facilities is to support the development of the Kumarghi Bolo (Upper Kumargh) and Duobai Sharqi (Eastern Duoba) gold deposits. TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC completed geological exploration works on the Upper Kumarg gold mine in October 2016.  There are also some indications that the China Eximbank loans for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to a 2021 IMF report, ‘[OHSHC “Barqi Tojik”] has significant arrears to the government on [foreign exchange] denominated loans. The government on-lends concessional [foreign exchange] loans […] from multilateral and bilateral agencies to [OHSHC “Barqi Tojik”] on non-concessional terms. These loans are denominated in [foreign exchange] and are intended to develop the energy infrastructure. However, these debts are not serviced fully, resulting in [foreign exchange] arrears to the government.’ A 2021 report by the International Energy Agency (IEA) elaborated on this point, explaining that ‘[a] high rate of uncollected payments for electricity use due to illegal connections, power theft and outdated metering infrastructure contribute to the worsening financial health of Barki Tojik.’ Then, in March 2023, the IMF published a report, which noted that ‘[I]n 2021 the SOE sector […] kept accumulating debt service losses, where within a year the amount of debt overdue payments […] increased from TJS 14 billion to TJS 17 billion (17.1 percent of GDP). Some 93 percent of accumulated overdue debt belongs to [OHSHC “Barqi Tojik”].’","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese Private Sector|Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient State-owned Company|Recipient Government Agency|Chinese Private Sector",198135970.030896,"This project involved the construction of a 400MW (Dushanbe-2) power plant in the city of Dushanbe, less than a kilometer from the city’s Botanical Garden.

Then, on October 25, 2013, China Eximbank and the Public Enterprise for State Roads of the Republic of Macedonia signed a $505,044,966.98 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the Kicevo-Ohrid Motorway Construction Project (captured via Project ID#66444). The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 20-year maturity, a 2% interest rate, a 5 year grace period, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee. The PBC was to be repaid in thirty semi-annual installments. On January 9, 2014, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the PBC. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 90% of the $555,549,463.68 cost of a commercial contract [ID#29-01-135] that it signed with Sinohydro Corporation Limited on June 5, 2012. The remaining 10% was provided by the Public Enterprise for State Roads. The 2013 PBC’s outstanding (principal) amount as of December 31, 2019 was $324,442,683.   The purpose of this project was to construct a 57-km long and 25.2-meter wide highway — with 6 overpasses, 13 underpasses, and a 2 km long tunnel named 'Preseka' — between the city of Kicevo and the city of Ohrid. The highway will pass through Kicevo, Podvis, Preseka, Pesocani, Trebenista, Podmolje, and Ohrid. Sinohydro Bureau 7. Co. Ltd (中国水电七局有限公司) — a subsidiary of Sinohydro Corporation Limited — was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on February 22, 2014 and the project was originally expected to reach completion on June 30, 2021. However, the project has encountered various delays and cost overruns. Some of these were due to poor geological surveys. Additionally, no intersections were part of the original road plan, which made it impossible to access the highway from villages along its route.   To address these cost overruns, China Eximbank and the Public Enterprise for State Roads of the Republic of Macedonia signed an additional PBC agreement worth $179,694,572.51 for the Kicevo-Ohrid Motorway Construction Project in 2019 (captured via Project ID#85195). It carried the same borrowing terms as the PBC that was signed on October 25, 2013: a 20-year maturity, a 2% interest rate, a 5 year grace period, a 0.25% commitment fee, and and a 0.25% management fee. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia issued a sovereign guarantee in support of this PBC on November 21, 2019.   On March 26, 2015, Macedonian opposition leader Zoran Zaev released audio recordings related to the construction of the highways. The recordings provided evidence that the tender process had not been transparent, and only two companies had been approved by the Chinese Embassy in Skopje: CWE and Sinohydro Corporation Limited. Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski was accused of disregarding CWE's lower bid and taking a bribe from Sinohydro Corporation Limited that amounted to 5% of the value of the commercial contract (approximately EUR 20,000,000). The EU intervened and made a deal in which a special prosecutor was appointed, and the Prime Minister stepped down. The special prosecutor charged the former Prime Minister in Charge of Economic Affairs, the former Minister of Transport, and the former Head of the Public Enterprise for National Roads with ‘Abuse of Official Position and Authorization’ on June 29, 2017. Former Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski was charged with ‘Accepting a Reward for Unlawful Influence’; he fled and received political asylum in Hungary. By 2019, the Special Prosecutor was also charged with corruption, the statute of limitations had expired, and no one was found guilty. In May of 2019, evidence was presented by newly appointed Director of Public Enterprise for State Roads that Sinohydro had only built 2.7 km of the highways, and had instead relied on subcontractors. Sinohydro Corporation Limited then marked up the subcontractor's invoices by 54% when it presented its invoices to the Public Enterprise for State Roads. Some of the items in the original bid had been marked up by as much as 300%. In 2019, Sinohydro Corporation Limited went through a more transparent tender process to build the Krupishte-Kocani highway, and the price per cubic meter was four times lower.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company",201898462.687809,"The purpose of this project was to construct a 57-km long and 25.2-meter wide highway — with 6 overpasses, 13 underpasses, and a 2 km long tunnel named 'Preseka' — between the city of Kicevo and the city of Ohrid.

In September 2008, the Chinese Government provided an RMB 800 million grant to the African Union Commission (AUC) for the African Union Conference Center and Office Complex Construction Project.   Dr Merriden Varrall, who previously served as Assistant Country Director and Senior Policy Advisor at UNDP China and worked on issues related to China’s international development cooperation policy in Beijing, has written that ""[w]here disputes exist about aid expenditure issues, the parties can go to the State Council for adjudication. One example where this occurred was in regard to the funding of the African Union Conference Hall in Addis Ababa, built at a cost of USD200 million, and inaugurated in 2012. According to a former MOFCOM official, MOFCOM and MFA both wanted more funding than MoF would allow. At first, MoF agreed to RMB200 million, about a fifth of the final total cost. MOFCOM negotiated hard, and MoF eventually increased the budget to RMB400 million, then RMB600 million, and finally to RMB800 million. In this case, as the official explained, MFA saw the diplomatic value of the project and thus agreed with MOFCOM that still more funding was necessary. Together they put the case to the State Council, and the then-Premier Wen agreed, apparently conceding that when it came to affairs such as this one, strategic considerations should outweigh the budget concerns of MoF.""  The purpose of the African Union Conference Center and Office Complex Construction Project was to construct an office building (with one underground floor and 20 floors above ground) and a conference center in Addis Ababa (exact locational coordinates: 9.0002, 38.7446). The office building occupies an area of 112,000 square meters.

The Ethiopian the House of Representatives ratified the PBC agreement under Proclamation no. 854/2014 on June 24, 2014. The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 2% interest rate, a 6 year grace period, and a maturity of 20 years.   The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance 85% of the cost of a $216,530,065.53 (ETB 3,986,318,506.35) commercial (EPC) contract between the Ethiopian Roads Authority (ERA) and China Geo-engineering Construction Overseas Company Group (CGCOC), which was signed on March 5, 2013. The ERA was responsible for directly funding 15% (ETB 597,947,775.95 or $32,479,509.829) of the commercial contract cost.   According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the ETB 3,824,329,330 China Eximbank loan achieved a 92% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 13 loan disbursements (worth ETB 3,504,749,269) between 2014 and 2019: an ETB 1,127,312,414 disbursement on December 5, 2014, an ETB 134,979,543 disbursement on September 22, 2015, an ETB 232,092,985 disbursement on January 27, 2016, an ETB 278,697,350 disbursement on March 22, 2016, an ETB 201,034,192 disbursement on June 28, 2016, an ETB 243,047,849 disbursement on November 17, 2016, an ETB 41,534,408 disbursement on February 9, 2017, an ETB 51,830,494 disbursement on May 10, 2017, an ETB 321,959,701 disbursement on June 20, 2017, an ETB 271,887,740 disbursement on September 25, 2017, an ETB 100,050,872 disbursement on February 1, 2018, an ETB 86,890,755 disbursement on April 27, 2018, and an ETB 413,430,966 disbursement on November 28, 2019.  The purpose of the project was to construct a 220 km toll road from Dire Dawa (Diredawa) to Dewalle (Dawale). The road was constructed according to the following standard: 7 meters wide and 5 cm thick single layer of asphalt concrete, with 2 by 1.5m at the highway shoulder. CGCOC was the general EPC contract responsible for project implementation. Shandong Great Supervision and Consultation Co., Ltd. provided the consulting services for the project. The project commenced in October 2014. It was completed in December 2018. The road was officially inaugurated on June 18, 2019.   Upon completion, the toll road was officially transferred to the Ethiopian Toll Roads Enterprises. The completion of the project has reportedly reduced the travel time from Dire Dawa city to the Djibouti border from 10 hours to 4 hours. However, according to an October 2021 report, '[t]hus far, there is not much traffic on the road, which leads through the desert and has almost no services or other urban settlements along it. This highway could become financially viable by providing a faster link between Addis Ababa and Djibouti, but only when the missing sections between AdamaAwash-Mieso-Dire Dawa are built. While the AfDB and the WB are preparing financing for some of these missing sections, Chinese financing of the Dire Dawa-Dewele section was premature.’ To access the toll road, truck drivers are required to pay ETB 200 ($7); mid-size trucks are required to pay ETB 150; and automobile drivers are required to pay ETB 100. As of late 2021, there was no data available on the amount of toll revenue generated by the road.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Dire Dawa-Dewalle Toll Road Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs.

The purpose of the project was to construct two separate Performing Arts Academies: The National Academy for the Performing Arts (NAPA) in Port of Spain (also known as the ‘north campus’), and the Southern Academy for the Performing Arts (SAPA) in San Fernando (also known as the ‘south campus’). Shanghai Construction Group (SCG) was the general EPC contractor (or ‘prime contractor’) responsible for project implementation. However, almost 30 sub-contractors from Trinidad and Tobago contributed nearly TT$100 million worth of goods and services during the completion of the project. The project was supervised by the Urban Development Corporation of Trinidad and Tobago (UDeCOTT) -- a state owned company of Trinidad and Tobago. Construction began in April 2007. NAPA was officially handed over to the Trinidadian Government on November 9, 2009, while SAPA was handed over on September 28, 2012.  However, this project became a major source of local controversy. On August 28, 2014, NAPA was deemed unsafe by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). It was subsequently closed for over two years, requiring $20 million dollars in renovations before reopening in January 2017. The issues cited were: badly secured lighting fixtures, shattered glass panes, issues with air quality, unsafe catwalks, unsafe stage areas, unsafe roofs, unsafe ceilings, loose bolts, and poor welding. Shanghai Construction Group did not cover the full cost of the renovations, citing that their maintenance contract only extended for a year after the building's construction. Michael Zhang, director of SCG Caribbean, stated that it was a misunderstanding and that sub-standard materials had been used, and that the company had done the best job it could. During the closure, Prime Minister Patrick Manning defended the structure as a ‘masterpiece.’  UDeCOTT chairman Calder Hart who supervised the initial construction of the project was accused of awarding TT$668 million worth of contracts to a Malaysian company that was linked to his wife Sherrine Hart.   The building is an ongoing expense for the Trinidadian government, which in 2014 paid TT$2,000,000 to support the structure and its performances. The maintenance cost was estimated at ten per cent of building cost per year, or TT$50 Million. It was part of Trinidad and Tobago's ‘Vision 2020’  initiative, which aimed to expand the cultural footprint of Trinidad and Tobago and substantially develop its urban areas.   NAPA contains a 53 room hotel and restaurant wing, which the Trinidadian parliament reported was not within the original design specifications. UDeCOTT has denied all allegations that the wing was constructed without approval. The wing was reported to be underutilized until 2018, when Cara hotels finally agreed to rent the structure, with no payment of its TT$390,000 lease expected until 2021.  NAPA was reportedly styled after the Chaconia, Trinidad and Tobago's national flower, and SAPA a ‘G-Clef’. NAPA has come under significant flak from the arts community, which cited a multitude of defective facilities. These included: no backstage loading door making many performances, including those of Trinidad's iconic Steel Drum, exceedingly difficult; accusations that the government outright lied about two smaller theaters on the premises, and that these are nothing but bare rooms; analogue lighting and sound equipment; concrete dance floors; no dressing rooms accessible from backstage; and no administrative offices (which required that the National Museum offices be temporarily evicted to make way for these), among numerous other complaints. The building was reportedly constructed with input from neither the arts community nor the university to which it was donated.  The same loans used to finance this project were also supposed to be used to construct a National Carnival Entertainment Centre directly behind NAPA. That project, however, remained unrealized as of June 2020.","Completion","Development","Loan","ODA-like","OTHER SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Other State-owned Company|Other Private Sector",206957469.800752,"The two buildings involved with the project are the National Academy for the Performing Arts (NAPA) and the Southern Academy for the Performing Arts (SAPA).

(2014) 30 TOTAL NO. (553)] and a $178,969,220 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2014) 40 TOTAL NO. (34)] for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. The GCL is captured via Project ID#46211 and the PBC is captured via Project ID#71137. Both of these loans were ratified by the Tajik Parliament on January 14, 2015. The GCL was contracted by the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and it carried the following borrowing terms: a 25 year maturity, an 11 year grace period, and a 1.5% interest rate. The PBC carries a 20 year maturity, a 9 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The Government of Tajikistan contributed $17,443,400 of counterpart financing. In total, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan contracted $331,058,220 of China Eximbank debt for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. The Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds of the GCL and the PBC to on-lend to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) “Barqi Tojik”. OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” was a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy. The subsidiary GCL agreement (#TАJ 2014-028-2) was signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” on December 18, 2014. It carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 25 years. Its final maturity date was set to August 21, 2039. The subsidiary PBC agreement (#TАJ 2014-028-1) was also signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” on December 18, 2014 and it carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 20 years. Its final maturity date was set to June 21, 2034.   Dushanbe 2 is a combined heat and power plant (CHP) — also known as the Dushanbe-2 Thermal Power Plant (TPS-2) — that provides heat and electricity for the residents of Dushanbe. It only operates in the winter. The 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project was designed and implemented in two phases. The power plant was to be fueled by coal, with the potential to switch to gas. Phase 1 (mainly constructed between 2012-2014) installed a capacity of 100 MW, while Phase 2 (constructed between 2014-2016) installed an additional capacity of 300 MW. TBEA was the general contractor responsible for implementation of both phases. Henan No 1 Thermal Power Construction Company was also involved in the implementation of Phase 1. Inner Mongolia Electric Power Survey and Design Institute Co., Ltd. was the contractor responsible for the design for Phase 2. Hydro Electric Power System Engineering Company was also involved in the implementation of Phase 2.   Phase 1 was originally scheduled to be completed and put into production before the celebration of the 20th anniversary of Tajik independence in 2011 (on September 9, 2011), and the second phase was scheduled to be completed in 2013. A formal groundbreaking ceremony for Phase 1 took place on September 8, 2009. However, construction did not begin until November 2012. Phase 1 was completed on September 13, 2014 and the first two (50MW) power generation units were put into operation on November 10, 2014. Phase 2 began on May 14, 2015 and was completed on December 8, 2016. According to President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon as relayed by TBEA, the power plant generates 9.6 million kWh power per day and 235 trillion Kcal heat, and it provides nearly 700 stable jobs to Tajiks. The electricity generated from the power plant is sold to Barki Tojik Open Stock Holding Power under a power purchase agreement. Through this project, 150 Tajik technicians went to China for training, and about 100 Tajik operators received professional know-how from Chinese experts. According to Xinhua, the completed power plant met 60 percent of the power demand and restarted the provision of central heating to more than 700,000 Dushanbe residents after 15 years of suspension. The completion of the power plant was declared to be a solution to Tajikistan's long-existing issue of power shortages during the winter.   However, it appears that the project’s second phase has encountered revenue generation and loan repayment problems. In 2018, the Government of Tajikistan reportedly granted a gold mining license to TBEA as ‘remuneration’ for Phase 2. Media reports indicate that TBEA agreed to work on the gold deposits as long as it takes to recoup the costs that it incurred during the construction of Phase 2. Several years later, in November 2021, TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC reported that it had completed half of the work on the construction of the gold processing plant and ancillary facilities in Ayni district of the northern province of Sughd, Tajikistan. The purpose of these facilities is to support the development of the Kumarghi Bolo (Upper Kumargh) and Duobai Sharqi (Eastern Duoba) gold deposits. TBEA Dushanbe Mining Company LLC completed geological exploration works on the Upper Kumarg gold mine in October 2016.","Completion","Commercial","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese Private Sector",210168116.868726,"This project involved the construction of a 400MW (Dushanbe-2) power plant in the city of Dushanbe, less than a kilometer from the city’s Botanical Garden.

SOMINA is the registered holder of the mining license for the Azelik Uranium Mine granted by the Government of Niger on November 8, 2007 for a period of 20 years covering a mining area of 220 square kilometers. On June 23, 2009, China Eximbank and SOMINA signed a $142,000,000 buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement for the Azelik Uranium Mine Project (captured via Project ID#91977). Under the terms of the BCL agreement, Somina was required to repay the loan in 11 installments, and pay interest on a quarterly basis. The loan was backed by a Sinosure credit insurance policy. It was also collateralized against equipment and vehicles owned by SOMINA and CNNC International Limited’s 37.2% equity stake in Somina. The outstanding principal of the GCL was approximately $90,880,000 on October 30, 2014, $78,100,000 on June 30, 2015, on $78,100,000 on August 19, 2015. Approximately three months earlier, on March 17, 2009, the Chinese Government and the Government of Niger signed a preferential loan framework agreement for the Azelik Uranium Mine Project. Then, in April 2011, China Eximbank and Société du Patrimoine des Mines du Niger (SOPAMIN) -- a Nigerian public holding company that manages the Government of Niger’s holdings in mining companies operating in the country — signed an RMB 650 million ($103 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Azelik Uranium Mine Project (captured via Project ID#256). The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate.   The proceeds of the loan were on-lent to SOMINA and used to finance the Government of Niger's 33% ownership stake in SOMINA.  The loan proceeds were also used by SOMINA to partially finance a $139.92 million commercial contract between Sinohydro Corporation Limited and China National Nuclear Corporation (CNCC), which was signed on March 31, 2008. Then, on August 24, 2009, SOMINA, as seller, and China Nuclear Energy Industry Corporation (中國原子能工業有限公司) (CNEIC),  as purchaser, entered into a Long-term Sales Contract. Under the terms of the Long-term Sales Contract, SOMINA agreed to sell and CNEIC agreed to purchase all uranium ore concentrates produced by SOMINA for a term ending on December 31, 2022. The purpose of the Azelik Uranium Mine Project was to develop the Teguidda mine at the Azelik uranium deposit. In addition to the development of the uranium mine, this project supported the construction of two coal-fired power plants and a hydrometallurgy plant.  China Nuclear International Uranium Corporation was responsible for the design of the project, and Sinohydro Corporation Limited was responsible for the implementation of the project. Trial operations of the mine began on December 10, 2010, with the first barrel of yellow cake uranium being produced on December 30, 2010. The mine officially started operations on March 17, 2011 and it reached a maximum capacity of 700 tons per year in 2012. However, mine production was suspended in mid-February 2015 due to cash flow problems. SOMINA reported at the time that its cash flow problems were the result of multiple factors, include the low and declining international price of uranium, delays in certain construction works related to the uranium mine, delays in the granting of a ‘favorable’ loan to SOMINA by the Government of Niger due to a military coup in Niger in 2010, and certain production process difficulties. In August 2015, SONIMA informed its shareholders that it extended a settlement with the local workforce for a temporary redundancy arrangement in compliance with the Niger labour law, until the end of August 2015. At that time, the mine was under temporary suspension and its production was expected to resume as soon as SOMINA’s cash flow position improved. However, as of 2021, mine production had still not resumed. SOMINA also faced criticism and pressure related to local protests over the lack of employment of local ethnic groups. low wages, and environmental degradation.This project also encountered a series of debt repayment problems.   On January 11, 2014, Focus International Development Corporation (FIDC) — a wholly-owned subsidiary of CNNC International Limited — and SOMINA signed a $4,500,000 bridge loan agreement with a 1-year maturity and an annual interest rate of 5.8% (captured via Project ID#91979).  As of the bridge loan’s final maturity date (December 31, 2014), the loan’s outstanding principal and interest were $4,343,257.88 and $182,856.78, respectively. Then, on January 2, 2015, FIDC and SOMINA signed a second bridge loan agreement worth $9,135,096.40 with a 2-year maturity and an annual interest rate of 7.8% (or the Hong Kong Dollar Best Lending Rate plus a 0.8% margin). The proceeds of the loan (captured via Project ID#91980) were to be used to refinance the accounts payable by SOMINA to CNNC (including the outstanding amount under the January 11, 2014 loan from FIDC), such that CNNC was not required to advance any new monies to SOMINA.    Also, in October 2014, SOMINA asked China Eximbank for an extension of the deadline for a $12,780,000 BCL (principal) repayment installment that was due on October 31, 2014 (and interest payment of approximately $444,000 for the third quarter of 2014). By February 2015, SOMINA met this repayment obligation. However, due to its tight cash flow position, SOMINA was not able to repay on time the next BCL (principal) repayment installment of $12,780,000 that was due on April 30, 2015. The borrower asked the lender for a repayment extension, and as of June 30, 2015, China Eximbank had not made any demands for immediate repayment of all outstanding debt or taken enforcement actions related to CNNC International Limited’s pledged 37.2% equity stake in SOMINA (which China Eximbank was entitled to do under the original terms of the June 23, 2009 loan agreement).","Completion","Commercial","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Other Joint Venture/Special Purpose Vehicle",213285426.85502,"This project supported the development of Teguidda mine at the Azelik uranium deposit.

Lahore, the capital of Punjab province, is Pakistan’s most populous and prosperous province with more than 5 million people. Pakistani officials expected the new transport system, the first of its kind in the country, to substantially decrease road traffic. Then, on December 21, 2015, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed three separate loan agreements for the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project. The first loan agreement is a $203.25 million buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement [ID#BC-OLL-2015 and ID#2015212493]. It carries a 5.2% interest rate, 2 year grace period, and 20 year maturity (captured via Project ID#53820). The second loan agreement is a $1,235,480,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2015) 34 TOTAL NO. (377) or ID#PBC-OLL15-34377]. It carries a 20 year maturity and a 2% interest rate (captured via Project ID#37280).

It carries a 2% interest rate and 20 year maturity (captured via Project ID#54420). The proceeds of the GCL, PBC, and BCL were used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract between Punjab Mass Transit Authority (PMA) and CR-NORINCO [a joint venture of China State Railway Group Co. Ltd. (CR) and China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO)], which was signed on April 20, 2015.   According to the Government of Pakistan’s Economic Affairs Division, $672.7 million of the “mixed credit” (GCL, PBC, and BCL) from China Eximbank had been disbursed as of June 30, 2017.  The Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project involved the construction of a 27km two-lane metro bus corridor runs through the heart of Lahore along Multan Road, McLeod Road, and GT Road. Upon completion, the Orange Metro Line was expected to have capacity for 30,000 passenger per hour and serve 250,000 passengers per day.   CR-NORINCO — a joint venture of China State Railway Group Co. Ltd. (CR) and China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) — was the entity responsible for project implementation. The project was initially expected to begin by the end of 2014 and last for 27 months (estimated completed date: March 31, 2017). The project was ultimately completed on December 10, 2019. However, it encountered various problems and delays during implementation. The Lahore Development Authority began marking sites for demolition in August 2015, including government buildings, royal tombs, mosques, schools, and residences. Civil works were then initiated by CN-NORINCO on October 25, 2015. Popular protests prompted the Lahore high court to suspend work surrounding heritage sites in January 2016 while the court deliberated the issue. Then, in August 2016, the Lahore high court ruled that the government could not evict people or harm the heritage sites. The Punjab provincial government challenged the ruling, and in April 2017, the Supreme Court reversed its decision, allowing construction to continue under 31 conditions to limit the disruption and damage of the project. Then, in May 2019, a special audit of the project project was submitted to the federal government. The audit revealed losses to the national exchequer and alleged irregularities worth billions of rupees. More specifically, the audit disclosed that no framework agreement existed between the federal and provincial governments and that sub-contractors were granted several contracts without any approval. The audit claimed that a loss of $1,528,000 had been incurred to the national exchequer. It also claimed more than $1.4 million had been spent on the basis of favoritism with regard to project allowance.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank government concessional loan for the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the government concessional loan agreement for the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project.

The purpose of the first phase of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project was to construct a new eight-lane asphalt expressway stretching 78 km from Addis Ababa to Adama. The alignment starts from Tulu Dimtu. The main road of the expressway continues 2.8 km along the proposed Addis Adaba outer ring road and then crosses Dukem, Bishoftu and Modjo on their east side. It then passes the old Addis Adama road at 62km and bypasses around Adama on the south side. The expressway ends on the east side of Adama and connects to Adama Awash road. The expressway has 18 km of link road and 7.2 km of frontage road on either side in Adama. The road work involved the construction of six interchanges, three intersections, 77 slab culverts, 36 underpasses and 43 overpasses. The 5.4m-high overpasses are supported by 73t girders, reinforced concrete piers and stone structures. Pedestrians, agricultural vehicles and cars can use three of the underpasses. The underpass for agricultural vehicles has a width of 4.5m and a height of 3.2m. The pedestrian underpass is 4.5m wide and 2.2m high. Car underpasses are larger in size with 6.5m width and 4.5m height. Flood discharge was used to size the culverts, which was designed according to velocity, water scouring and water levels. The project also included the construction of two main toll gates and 13 ramp toll gates.   The ultimate objective of the project was to reduce the travel time on Ethiopia's main import-export route from three hours to one hour. The project also sought to lay the groundwork for the use of innovative technology via tolls and creates local employment opportunities. Upon completion, the project was expected to contribute to the development of roadways between the capital city and other regions, such as Hawassa and Bale.  The Addis-Adama Expressway (AAE) is fully access-controlled and managed by Ethiopian Toll Road Enterprise (ETRE). CCCC was the EPC contractor responsible for the implementation of the project’s first phase and second phase. Phase 1 construction began on April 21, 2010.  According to Samson Wondimu, the Communication Director of ERA, the project’s first phase had achieved a 33.6% completion rate as of April 2012. By September 2012, it had achieved a 50% completion rate. A completion ceremony for the first phase of the project was held on May 5, 2014.   The second phase of the project (also known as the Lebu-Akaki-Information Technology Park Outer Ring Road Project, the Lebu-Akaki IT Park Outer Ring Road Project, and the Akaki-Goro and Akaki-Lebu Road Project) involved the construction of a 28.1 km toll road — with three lanes each 3.5 meters wide — that links Adama Town in Oromia State with Addis Ababa. Phase 2 supported two road sections: a 14.6 km Akaki-ICT Park (Goro) road section and a 13.6 km Akaki-Lebu road section. Phase 2 also involved the construction of six bridges, one railway line interchange, and three interchanges at Tulu Dimitu, Akaki and Lebu. Upon completion, the project’s second phase was expected to ease traffic congestion along the Akaki-Bishoftu corridor.   Phase 2 began implementation on May 5, 2014 and was originally scheduled to reach completion within 25 months (June 5, 2016). By November 27, 2014, the second phase of the project had achieved a 27% completion rate. By June 2015, the second phase of the project had achieved a 50% completion rate. Phase 2 was ultimately completed on August 6, 2016. After the completion of first and second phases of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project, traffic volumes on the expressway reportedly exceeded 20,000 vehicles per day on the two-lane road trunk road between Addis Ababa and Adama. In October 2019, an official from the Ethiopian Toll Roads Enterprise (ETRE) reported that around 33 million cars had used the toll expressway over the previous five years, generating around $34 million of revenue for the country. However, according to an October 2021 report, '[a]fter 5 years [the expressway] has earned back only about $30 million in toll revenue, well short of expectations. Ethiopia built the toll road parallel to an existing free highway, and a lot of the traffic has remained on the old road.'  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 2 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs.

The face value of the PBC was subsequently revised to $176,538,461.54. The PBC carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 6-year grace period, and a 20-year maturity. The loan is scheduled for semi-annual repayments in equal installments from January 21, 2018, to January 21, 2032. The borrower is expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $216 million commercial (EPC) contract between Kenya National Highways Authority and China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), which was signed on November 17, 2010.   The borrower made principal repayments worth $7,061,538.46 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and $14,123,076.92 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022). The loan’s amount outstanding was $169,476,923.08 as of June 30, 2020, $155,353,846.15 as of June 30, 2021, and $141,230,769.23 as of June 30, 2022.   The purpose of the Southern Bypass Project was to ease traffic congestion in Nairobi and divert traffic from the city center. The 28.6 km road starts at the junction of the Nairobi–Mombasa Road and Likoni Road, approximately 10 kilometers (6 mi) south-east of the city center. The road then loops through the south-western suburbs of Nairobi, including the northern environs of Nairobi National Park, Uhuru Gardens, Lang'ata, and Dagoretti. In Dagoretti, the road enters Kiambu County and then turns northwards, to pass through Muguga and end in the town of Kikuyu, in a suburb known as Gitaru. At that location, the road connects with the Nairobi-Malaba Road (A104).   Under the supervision of the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA), CRBC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation of the project. The EPC contract went into effect on July 2, 2012. By June 2015, the project had achieved a 81.3% completion rate. However, at that time, CRBC was not in possession of the site for the National Park section due to a lengthy court case by Friends of the Nairobi National Park, which obtained an injunction that stopped KeNHA from constructing the road through the National Park. A court eventually ruled that KeNHA should follow due process and have the section of the National Park that was to be used for road construction appropriately gazetted. Upon gazettement, there were prolonged negotiations around the acquisition of a section of the National Park to facilitate the construction of the project. Negotiations between KeNHA and Kenya Wildlife Service for a grant of easement were subsequently completed and an agreement was signed on September 23, 2015. CRBC was granted possession of the site for the project's National Park section on November 2, 2015. Construction activities were substantially complete as of June 22, 2016 (with a defect liability of 12 months). The project was officially completed on November 1, 2016.  The originally scheduled project completion date (per the EPC contract) was July 31, 2015.   There are indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Southern Bypass Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In March 2022, reports emerged that the Government of Kenya had delayed payments worth more than 3.6 billion Kenyan shillings that were owed to CRBC and landowners displaced by the project, exposing the Government of Kenya to financial penalties and additional interest payments. Kenya’s Auditor General Nancy Gathungu said that the Treasury had fallen behind in remitting 1.2 billion Kenyan shillings to CRBC for the Southern Bypass Project. Gathungu also said that the Treasury had delayed 2.4 billion Kenyan shillings in compensation to landowners displaced by the project corridor. Gathungu warned that taxpayers would be saddled with more financial penalties and additional interest payments if the Kenyan Government did not regularize its payments: '[a]lthough the management has committed to liaise with the line ministry and the National Treasury for adequate budgetary allocation and timely exchequer releases for prompt payments in the subsequent financial year, the project is at risk of incurring additional costs by way of interests and penalties with the continued delay in making the payments.'","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Government Agency",217121155.092525,"The 28.6 km southern bypass road starts at the junction of the Nairobi–Mombasa Road and Likoni Road, approximately 10 kilometres (6 mi) south-east of the city centre.

Borrowings through the line of credit were to be used for the development of infrastructure and resource projects in Kazakhstan. Then, on October 13, 2009, KAZ Minerals PLC (also known as ‘Kazakhmys Corporation LLC’ and ‘Kazakhmys’) announced that it was in discussions with CDB and Samruk-Kazyna regarding a major unsecured loan facility. Following a memorandum of financial cooperation that was signed by Kazakhmys, Samruk-Kazyna and CDB on November 14, 2009, $2.7 billion from the $3 billion line of credit was allocated to various projects of KAZ Minerals PLC. Then, on December 30, 2009, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC (also known as Kazakhmys Finance PLC) — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of KAZ Minerals PLC — and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $2 billion facility (loan) agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project. On the same day, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $100 million facility (loan) agreement for the Bozymchak Copper and Gold Mine Development Project.

59753,"China (People's Republic of)","Uganda","Africa",2015,NA,"China Eximbank provides RMB 1.26 billion loan for Phase 1 of Entebbe International Airport Upgrading and Expansion Project","On March 31, 2015, the Chinese Government and the Government of Uganda signed a preferential loan framework agreement for Phase 1 of the Entebbe International Airport Upgrading and Expansion Project. On the same day, China Eximbank and the Government of Uganda signed an RMB 1,260,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) loan agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2015) 6 TOTAL NO. (545)] for Phase 1 of the Entebbe International Airport Upgrading and Expansion Project.  Uganda’s Parliament then ratified the loan agreement on July 29, 2015. Several months later, on November 17, 2015, the Government of Uganda entered into a subsidiary, on-lending agreement with Uganda Civil Aviation Authority (UCAA). The borrowing terms of the GCL are as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.25% (RMB 3,150,000) management fee, and a 0.25% commitment fee. The first scheduled loan repayment date is April 1, 2022.   The GCL is secured by (collateralized against) airport revenues deposited in a lender-controlled bank account with a minimum cash balance requirement. A December 3, 2015 escrow account agreement between the Government of Uganda's Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development, Stanbic Bank Uganda Limited, UCAA, and China Eximbank specifies that the borrower must maintain a minimum cash balance in the repayment reserve account of RMB 25,200,000 during the loan’s grace period (equivalent to total payable interest for one year during the loan’s grace period) and RMB 98,870,000 during the loan’s repayment period (equivalent to total payable principal and interest for one year during the loan’s repayment period). The GCL agreement also specifies that the 'all the revenues (proceeds) of Entebbe International Airport (including but not limited to revenues generated from the Project) shall be applied in priority to payment of any and all amounts due and payable [to the lender].' Under the terms of an Escrow Account Agreement, UCAA also agreed to (a) seek secure advance approval from China Eximbank for any use of the airport revenues that it deposits in the escrow account; and (b) grant China Eximbank approval authority over the airport’s annual budgets.   The ultimate borrower/end-user (UCAA) is expected to use the GCL proceeds to finance a $200,000,000 commercial (EPC) contract between UCAA and China Communications Construction Company (CCCC), which was signed on October 8, 2014 and amended on January 12, 2015.   According to the Government of Uganda’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), this loan achieved a 78% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 26 loan disbursements (worth $156,639,169.44) between 2015 and 2021: a $60,124,334.71 disbursement on December 24, 2015, a $9,822,292.39 disbursement on November 15, 2016, a $4,473,339.53 disbursement on December 14, 2016, a $5,272,753.02 disbursement on March 29, 2017, a $2,363,019.84 disbursement on April 20, 2017, a $1,336,370.91 disbursement on May 25, 2017, a $1,237,900.78 disbursement on August 10, 2017, a $5,492,164.36 disbursement on November 21, 2017, a $3,445,536.22 disbursement on December 27, 2017, a $21,668,252.97 disbursement on April 19, 2019, a $3,032,693.76 disbursement on May 30, 2019, a $3,743,156.53 disbursement on August 22, 2019, a $3,074,851.76 disbursement on October 31, 2019, a $2,911,749.34 disbursement on November 25, 2019, a $2,683,403.29 disbursement on March 31, 2020, a $1,275,590.33 disbursement on April 27, 2020, a $3,197,241.55 disbursement on May 27, 2020, a $1,758,890.15 disbursement on July 24, 2020, a $1,831,735.75 disbursement on August 7, 2020, a $1,944,401.91 disbursement on September 28, 2020, a $3,835,965.97 disbursement on December 18, 2020, a $4,414,162.60 disbursement on November 24, 2021, a $3,128,465.91 disbursement on March 30, 2022, a $2,110,577.92 disbursement on August 17, 2022, a $1,314,054.62 disbursement on November 17, 2022, and a $1,146,263.31 disbursement on December 13, 2022.  According to the Uganda Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development's Report on Public Debt, Grants, Guarantees and Other Financial Liabilities for Financial Year 2021/2022, as of December 31, 2021, total loan disbursements amounted to $155,982,698.23 and the loan’s amount outstanding (including arrears) was $155,982,698.23.   The purpose of the project’s first phase is to upgrade and expand Entebbe International Airport. The airport is located at 5 minutes from the main campus of Kampala International University, near the town of Entebbe, on the shores of Lake Victoria, and approximately 40.5 kilometers (25 mi) by road south-west of the central business district of Kampala, the capital and largest city of Uganda. Its exact locational coordinates are 00°02′41″N 032°26′35″E”. Phase 1 activities include constructing a new cargo terminal, resurfacing the main runway with new lighting, constructing a new terminal building (that is adjacent and connected to the existing terminal and with aerobridges), repairing, strengthening and expanding the main apron serving the existing terminal and the new terminal, repairing the second runway and associated taxiways, repairing Apron 2 (which serves VVIPs or Very Very Important Persons), strengthening Apron 4 (which serves general aviation and cargo aircraft), replacing aging navigation aids, and constructing a multi-story car park. The total cost of Phase 1 is $200 million and the total cost of Phase 2 is $125 million. These two phases were originally expected to take 5 years to implement. It is expected that, upon completion, the expanded and upgraded airport will increase annual passenger output at the airport from 1.5 million to 3.5 million and freight volume of the completed freight center from 55,000 tons to 100,000 tons CCCC is the contractor responsible for project implementation. Dar Al-Handasah (Shair & Partners) is responsible for project supervision. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on August 29, 2015. Construction began on May 10, 2016. As of June 2019, the project had achieved a 52% completion rate. As of October 26, 2021, the Government of Uganda’s Aid Management Platform summarized the status of the project in the following manner: ‘Physical Progress: The overall performance of the civil works currently stands at 50%. One runway is complete; works on the runway apron are halfway and 80% of the works on the cargo building have been achieved. Challenges: Overdue IPC Payments which have led to accrual of interest charges e.g accrued interest for [Interim Payment Certificate]# 1 up to [Interim Payment Certificate] #23 as of July 11th 2019 stood at USD 951,368.49. This increases by the month. Progress of the Cargo Terminal and Airfield Works continues but require intense supervision to ensure acceptable workmanship and approved materials are employed. Some [overdue] approved materials for the Cargo Complex are not yet delivered to [the project site], meaning that delays encountered so far will not be recovered. The project still reports approximately Eleven Months delay and the Contractor [CCCC] is still reluctant to [reprogram its] work in accordance with Clause 8.3 of the General Conditions of Contract, to include measures intended to recover lost time. It is also evident that project completion cannot be achieved by May 2021. In addition, challenges for construction include coordination difficulties with the extensive fuel network (by Tristar) and with Airport Operations, Safety and Security, due to the naturally intrusive nature of construction within an operational environment. Runway 17/35 and Apron 1 Works are particularly noted in this respect.  By November 2021, the project had achieved an overall completion rate or 75.1%. Then, in March 2022, construction of the cargo terminal was completed. Li Qinpu, a project manager of the CCCC, said at the peak of the construction of the cargo terminal, the project employed 80 Chinese workers and more than 900 local workers at different skills levels. Phase 1 was originally expected to reach completion by May 9, 2021. However, this date was subsequently pushed out to December 5, 2022. The expected completion date of the project’s second phase (which had not yet secured financing as of March 2022) is March 2024. The Entebbe International Airport Upgrading and Expansion Project has become a source of local and international controversy. One set of concerns relate to the potentially inflated cost of the underlying commercial contract. CCCC (the EPC contractor) pre-financed the feasibility study for the design and implementation of project. The feasibility study report submitted to CAA in December 2013 costed Phase 1 of the project at $200,000,000, which paved the way for the signing of a $200,000,000 commercial contract between CAA and CCCC on October 2014. There was, however, no independent review of the feasibility estimates by UCAA during the procurement stage which would have informed the Government of Uganda on the reasonableness and accuracy of the cost estimates prior to agreeing to CCCC securing the funds from China Eximbank.   Additionally, the UCAA contracts committee approved the project cost in the feasibility study on September 23, 2014 without undertaking an independent evaluation of these costs. Another set of concerns relate to the collateralization arrangement that underpins the China Eximbank loan agreement and an Escrow Account Agreement in which UCAA reportedly granted China Eximbank approval authority over the Entebbe International Airport’s annual budgets and UCAA’s use of revenues from the airport in the escrow account. The loan agreement states that repayment of the China Eximbank loan is the responsibility of the “end user” (CAA) and the escrow account (established as a requirement of the loan agreement to facilitate repayment) should be funded using airport revenues. However, in January 2019, Uganda’s Auditor General revealed that the Government of Uganda’s Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development had made interest payments on the loan and but not deposited airport revenues in the escrow account. The Auditor General also noted that “inconsistencies in the operationalization of the agreements and the involved parties’ deemed actions represent non-compliance/ breach of contract that could result in penalties and even cancellation of the [loan] facility.” By March 2019, China Eximbank responded to the borrower’s non-compliance with escrow account conditions by halting loan disbursements, which in turn led to the Government of Uganda falling behind on payments to CCCC (the EPC contractor). This resulted in major construction delays. CCCC’s payment certificates 11-23 (worth $24.5 million) for work performed between December 2017 and February 2019 were not paid, which led to a project implementation standstill that lasted for 361 days. UCAA later told a parliamentary oversight body that “[t]hese [escrow account] conditions were not palatable for an international airport of a sovereign state whose operations are dynamic and sometimes unpredictable.” The Government of Uganda responded on March 6, 2019 by dispatching an 11-member delegation (consisting of CAA officials, Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development officials, the Deputy Solicitor General, and Uganda’s Ambassador to China, H.E. Dr. Crispus C.W. Kiyonga) to Beijing to renegotiate so-called ‘toxic clauses’ in the loan agreement with China Eximbank. According to an internal Government of Uganda record (a September 5, 2019 memo/letter from Finance Minister Matia Kasaija to Public Works Minister Monica Azuba Ntege), “[w]hile the initial agenda was to cause a re-negotiation of specific clauses in the original financing agreement that seemed very unsuitable to [the Government of Uganda] and therefore to the end user (UCAA), the [China Eximbank] officials made it clear from the onset that re-negotiation and amendment of the loan agreement were not agreeable to them. The Bank proposed, which the [Government of Uganda delegation] found plausible, that rather than having a re-negotiation, we could have a ‘clarification’ of the contentious clauses with a view of having a workable interpretation. It was the understanding of all parties that to achieve a win-win situation, the contentious clauses would be interpreted with a view of having a balanced effect that would enable resumption of disbursement without necessarily amending the agreement. The Bank’s view was that such an amendment if allowed would set a bad precedent and more so, they saw no cause to warrant the amendment.   In that regard, it was agreed that: i) The Bank resumes financing through disbursements and makes flexible the conditions set around the Escrow Account Agreement clauses especially the provision requiring UCAA to deposit all airport revenues [in] this account. The Bank clarified that the objective of the sales collection account was to see [UCAA’s] inflows and outflows for this account and that since the minimum reserve amount was already available on the debt reserve payment account, the funds would henceforth be available for [UCAA’s] operations. It was agreed that the Borrower [the Ministry of Finance, Planning and Economic Development] shares proof of the banking on the sales collection account as a trigger for the Bank to unlock disbursements. This has since been implemented. ii) Another contentious matter that the delegation wanted to be varied was the provision requiring UCAA to submit for approval all their operational budgets to [China Eximbank]. The Bank clarified that they were interested in the project budget but since this budget was subsumed in other UCAA operational activities, UCAA was henceforth required to share approved budgets with the Bank for review only and not for approval.” China Eximbank and the Government of Uganda delegation also reportedly agreed to keep the details of their meeting (‘minutes of the meeting’) confidential. Then, on December 20, 2019, Uganda’s Office of the Auditor General publish a report that criticized Uganda’s Ministry of Finance for the borrowing terms in the Entebbe airport loan agreement and several other loan agreements with China Eximbank: “A review of the various facility agreements for issued [China Eximbank] loans revealed that the [Government of Uganda] was obliged to open escrow accounts where the government was expected to make advance deposit of funds over the tenure of the loan required for the repayment of the loan. It was observed that some of the escrow bank accounts are held with local commercial banks while others are held in the Lenders countries. […] The funds are deposited on commercial bank accounts upfront and the creditors have access to them before even the loans are disbursed. Government of Uganda has no control over these accounts. The practice causes financial strain to the cash flows of the country and maybe as a result of weaknesses in negotiations that are undertaken by the government of Uganda and the lenders. These funds could have been used as advance to start the implementation of the projects for which the financing is required. The practice distorts the Government [of Uganda]s] cash flows and monetary control policy. The [Government of Uganda’s] Accounting Officer promised to improve on the way [the Government] negotiate[s] loans with escrow conditionalities. [Uganda’s Auditor General] advised the Accounting [Officer] to in future avoid loans with such unfavourable terms or negotiate to have such terms softened.”   Then, in October 2021, a parliamentary panel led by opposition politicians revealed that the Government of Uganda’s arrangement with China Eximbank requires that all of UCAA’s revenues and expenditures pass through accounts controlled by China Eximbank at a Kampala branch of South Africa’s Standard Bank Group Ltd. (Stanbic Bank), which is itself partly owned by Beijing’s biggest state-owned bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). Members of Parliament’s Committee on Commissions, Statutory Authorities and State Enterprise (Cosase) raised questions and concerns about the wisdom of granting financial oversight power (and influence over which creditors get paid first) — normally reserved for the country’s treasury and parliament — to a Chinese state-owned bank. They also questioned the wisdom of the Ugandan Government limiting its own ability to tap into revenue from rapidly expanding tourism and exports. [Note: Entebbe International Airport is a regional hub airport. Traffic has soared over the past decade and is expected to grow more amid a $15 billion crude-oil development project along Uganda’s border with the Democratic Republic of Congo.] Joel Ssenyonyi, a member of parliament who led the panel, said “It’s appalling. […] that [China Eximbank] now has to approve any budget spending [of UCAA].” On October 28, 2021, Uganda's Finance Minister Matia Kasaija was called before the parliamentary panel and questioned over the terms of the loan. He apologized to the lawmakers, noting that “we shouldn’t have accepted some of the clauses. [...] But they told you . . . either you take it or leave it.” He also said the loan would be repaid and there was no chance that the airport would be seized by the lender. Then, on November 25, 2021, a local newspaper in Uganda (The Daily Monitor) published a report, which suggested that the China Eximbank loan agreement “if not amended, [could] expose Uganda's sovereign assets to attachments and take-over upon arbitration awards in Beijing.” Two days later, on November 27, 2021, UCAA Spokesperson Vianney M Luggya tweeted that “It is true that @UgandaCAA opened up a Sales Collection Account in @stanbicug where all the [UCAA’s] revenues are deposited in line with the Escrow Account Agreement terms, but it does not mean that anyone is to control our finances.” Luggya also tweeted that “The [UCAA] enjoys the freedom & liberty of spending what is collected (as per the budget). The lender’s monitoring of the account is only similar to what happens when one gets a salary loan or any other loan, & the bank requests that the salary is channeled through their bank. It does not mean that lending bank takes over your salary.” In late 2021, internal disagreements within the executive branch of the Ugandan Government also spilled into public view. Uganda's Finance Minister Matia Kasaija reportedly advocated for adherence to the agreement that the Government of Uganda struck with China Eximbank in March 2019 (as codified in the ‘minutes of the meeting’). However, UCAA and the Ministry of Public Works reportedly treated Kasaija’s position ‘with disdain for allegedly blind-spotting a deal that presents real risks to Uganda's sovereign assets.’ UCAA officials reportedly flagged up to 13 clauses in the China Eximbank agreement as ""unfair” or a threat to “the sovereignty of Uganda.” A confidential source told the a local newspaper in Uganda that “it’s clear that [U]CAA will lose its rights of use and control over its revenues […] as a self-financing institution with limited funding. Such provisions would expose the [organization] to risk of failure in service delivery and bankruptcy.” In June 2020, David Kakuba, who was the Director General of UCAA at that time, warned that granting China Eximbank approval authority over UCAA’s budgeting and planning decisions “exposes UCAA to risk of failure to deliver its mandate, and infringes on State's effective control over UCAA.” After Kakuba’s retirement, the Acting UCAA Director General Fred Bamwesigye wrote to Works Minister Gen Edward Katumba Wamala on September 8, 2021 and reminded him of the importance of renegotiating the loan agreement with China Eximbank. He also asked him to remind Minister of Finance Matia Kasaija to notify China Eximbank of the need to amend the agreement to make it consistent with Ugandan law and international law. He wrote that “whereas some of the provisions referred to were alluded to in the Minutes of the Negotiations, the unfair clauses remain embedded in the agreements, while in some cases, they were not dealt with at all. […] There is, therefore, an urgent need to start the review and renegotiation of the Government Concession Loan Agreement... in order to reduce the intentions of the parties into a legally-binding agreement.” Then, on December 11, 2019, David Kakuba warned Minister of Finance Matia Kasaija that “any seeming delay or any form of understanding that is not reduced into an amended agreement of the signed ones, would maintain the enforceability by [China Eximbank] of the disputed agreement.” He also noted that Section 10.3 of the Repayment Mechanism Agreement provides for a waiver of immunity and states that ‘each obligor hereby irrevocably waives any immunity on grounds of sovereign or other immunity for itself or any of its property in connection with any arbitration proceeding or with enforcement of any arbitral awards any court judgement.' Such a provision, if not amended, David Kakuba argues ""exposes government assets to attachments and take-over upon arbitration awards in China.” Around the same time, Uganda’s Ministry of Public Works reportedly asked the Ministry of Finance to seek a speedy revision and resolution of the ‘problematic clauses’ in the China Eximbank loan agreement. However, in December 2021, Bloomberg reported that “Uganda’s chief legal officer urged the Finance Ministry to refrain from renegotiating the terms of [the China Eximbank loan agreement] as it is able to meet its debt obligations.”","Implementation","Development","Loan","ODA-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Government Agency",224977966.173123,"The airport is located at 5 minutes from the main campus of Kampala International University, near the town of Entebbe, on the shores of Lake Victoria, and approximately 40.5 kilometers (25 mi) by road south-west of the central business district of Kampala, the capital and largest city of Uganda.

Then, in July 2007, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and Uzbekneftegaz signed an agreement on construction and operation of the Uzbek Sections of Lines A and B of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline.  On November 18, 2008, Asia Trans Gas LLC (or Asia-Trans Gas LLC or СП ООО “Asia TransGas”) — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited (TAPLINE) [50% equity stake] and Uzbekneftegaz National Holding Company (UNG) [50% equity stake] that was created on January 28, 2008 — signed a $3.5 billion syndicated loan agreement with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BoC) for the Uzbek Sections of Lines A and B of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline Project. CDB's $1.75 billion contribution is captured in Project ID #91901 and BOC's $1.75 billion contribution is captured in Project ID #91917. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower pledged the pipeline itself as a source of collateral to the lenders. The proceeds of the loan were used by the borrower to finance EPC contracts with China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau, China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Corporation (CPECC), and Zeromax GmbH.  The purpose of the project was to construct the Uzbek sections of Line A and Line B of the 1873 km Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline. These sections both measure 529 km in length and they run parallel to each other from Gedaim on the Turkmen-Uzbek border through central Uzbekistan. The project also involved the construction of three compressor stations. China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau, China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Corporation (CPECC), and Zeromax GmbH were the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on June 30, 2008. Then, on October 1, 2008, the first compressor station of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline was built in Uzbekistan's Qasqadaryo province. The Uzbek section of Line A was put into operation in December 2009. Also, on December 14, 2009, the Presidents of China, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan attended the inauguration ceremony of the China-Central Asia Gas Pipeline at the gas plant on the right bank of the Amu Darya River in Turkmenistan, and turned on the gas flow together. The first batch of gas arrived in China in January 2010.  Then, on June 9, 2010, CNPC signed a framework agreement on the purchase and sale of natural gas with Uzbekneftegaz, which specified that Uzbekistan would supply 10 billion cubic meters of natural gas to China annually. Two months later, in August 2010, the Uzbek section of Line B was officially commissioned. The Uzbek section of Line B became operational in October 2010. A delivery capacity of 30 billion cubic meters per annum was reached by the end of 2011. It was originally envisaged that the Uzbek section of Line A would be built by December 31, 2009 and put into operation by January 2010, while the Uzbek section of Line B would reach completion by December 31, 2011.  Then, on September 21, 2011, CNPC and Uzbekneftegaz signed an agreement on the construction and operation of the Uzbek Section of Line C of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline. In 2013, Asia Trans Gas LLC signed a $1.4 billion syndicated loan agreement with China Development Bank and Bank of China for the Uzbek Section of Line C of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline Project. CDB’s contribution to the syndicated loan amounted to $1.2 billion (captured via Project ID#54528).

The face value of the loan was subsequently revised to RMB 1,026,923,076.92. The loan was provided with the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, an 8 year grace period, and a 20.25 year maturity (final maturity date: March 21, 2030).    The borrower made principal repayments worth RMB 41,076,923 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and RMB 82,153,846.16 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2020-2022).

The 50km highway is located in the northeast of the Nairobi Metropolitan Region (NMR) and it extends from Nairobi City Center to Thika District. The trunk road currently serves as a main cargo route and an important metropolitan, regional and international transit link and is part of the classified international trunk road A2, which originates in Nairobi City Center and extends to Moyale, Ethiopia. The road also acts as a main artery for various satellite towns and economic hubs that lie along and near the corridor, including Ruaraka, Kasarani, Kiambu Town, Githurai, Ruiru, Juja, and Thika.   The project consisted of 3 lots and it was co-financed by the African Development Bank, China Eximbank, and the Government of Kenya. China Eximbank funded Lot 3 (the 23.8 km road segment from Kenyatta University to Thika) and the African Development Bank and the Government of Kenya financed Lots 1 and 2. The first lot (Lot 1) comprised the rehabilitation and upgrading of three Nairobi City Arterial Connectors to the Nairobi - Thika Road (A2) for a total of 12.4 km. The components were: Forest Road from Pangani to A104 Museum Roundabout (3.6 km); Muranga Road from Muthaiga to A104 at University Way Roundabout (4.5 km); and Kariakor Road from Pangani to A104 at Haile Selasse Road Roundabout (4.3 km). The second lot (Lot 2) covered the rehabilitation and expansion of the 14.1 km Muthaiga - Kenyatta University stretch on the Nairobi - Thika road (km 3+900 - km 18 + 00). The third lot (Lot 3) involved the rehabilitation and upgrading of the 23.88 km Kenyatta University (km 18+000) to Thika (km 41+880) section of the road.   3 Chinese contractors were responsible for project implementation: Shengli, Sinohydro Corp and China Wu Yi. China Wu Yi worked on Lot 1, Sinohydro worked on Lot 2, and Shengli worked on Lot 3. The project was initiated on January 22, 2009, and completed on October 11, 2011. The project was originally expected to reach completion, as per the project implementation schedule, on July 21, 2011.    This project was designed with a robust monitoring and evaluation mechanism. Baseline data collected at the beginning of the project were compared with enplane data collected at project at completion. The indicators are largely “SMART”: measures of mobility assessed through changes in traffic flows; accessibility, tracked using journey speed survey data at the beginning and at completion of the project; increased inter-regional trade flows between Eastern Africa and the Horn of Africa, measured through secondary economic data in 2007 and assessed against target flows in 2011; traffic accident data in 2007 assessed against crash data in 2013; and average land values within the project corridor measured before and after the project. The outcome data at project completion were impressive: traffic flows increased from 85,000 vehicles per day in 2007 to 123,000 vehicles per day in 2012 (45% increase in mobility); journey speeds rose from 8km/hour to at least 45km/hour in sections with the highest registered traffic; the number of traffic accidents fell; and land values rose from $23 thousand to $46 thousand per acre in Thika, and even more in areas closer to the city like Kasarani—from $46 thousand up to $500 thousand per acre.","Completion","Development","Loan","ODA-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company",225784604.237398,"This project supported the rehabilitation and upgrading of the 23.88 km road segment (lot 3) of the Nairobi-Thika Highway Improvement Project, which runs from from Kenyatta University (km 18+000) to Thika (km 41+880).

The MOU indicated that China Eximbank was willing, in principle, to lend as much as $248 million to ADM for the project. According to the MOU, China International Water & Electric Corporation (CWE) and China Overseas Engineering Group (COVEC) would be responsible for the construction of several segments of the expressway.  The Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) also agreed to contribute KD 55 million and EUR 220 million, respectively, for the project.    The purpose of the project was to construct a two-way, four-lane, 173 km expressway from Berrechid to Beni Mellal that runs straight through the Atlas Mountains. The expressway would run parallel to highway N11 and it was designed to relieve traffic on highway N11. The Berrechid–Beni Mellal Expressway Construction Project consisted of five sections. The first section between Berrechid and Ben Ahmed (38.6 km) was built by CWE. It originates on the existing Casablanca-Settat motorway north of Berrechid. It then bypasses the city of Morjana (PK 3) from the south and passes north of the Mbarkine region. It crosses the RP 3602 and the RP3625 at the level of the Oulad Sghir locality. It then crosses, in Lourarga, the RP3606 and bypasses the mountainous area of ​​Oulad Amar to the north before crossing the RR305 at Oulad Damar (PK 35). The second section, between Ben Ahmed and Khouribga (38.5 km) and the third section between Khouribga and Oued Zem (33 km), was built by four local Moroccan contractors: Société Internationale De Travaux Maroc (SINTRAM), LRN, Seprob and the Société Nouvelle Des Conduites d'Eau (SNCE). The fourth section between Oued Zem and Kasba Tadla (40 km) was built by a Moroccan contractor, Houar. The fifth section, between Kasba Tadla and Beni Mellal (22 km) was built by COVEC.   In 2011, China Eximbank and ADM signed a $184 million buyer's credit loan agreement for 38.6 km Berrechid-Ben Ahmed Section of Berrechid–Beni Mellal Expressway Construction Project (i.e. the first section).

Lahore, the capital of Punjab province, is Pakistan’s most populous and prosperous province with more than 5 million people. Pakistani officials expected the new transport system, the first of its kind in the country, to substantially decrease road traffic. Then, on December 21, 2015, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed three separate loan agreements for the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project. The first loan agreement is a $203.25 million buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement [ID#BC-OLL-2015 and ID#2015212493]. It carries a 5.2% interest rate, 2 year grace period, and 20 year maturity (captured via Project ID#53820).

It carries a 2% interest rate and 20 year maturity (captured via Project ID#54420). The proceeds of the GCL, PBC, and BCL were used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract between Punjab Mass Transit Authority (PMA) and CR-NORINCO [a joint venture of China State Railway Group Co. Ltd. (CR) and China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO)], which was signed on April 20, 2015.   According to the Government of Pakistan’s Economic Affairs Division, $672.7 million of the “mixed credit” (GCL, PBC, and BCL) from China Eximbank had been disbursed as of June 30, 2017.  The Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project involved the construction of a 27km two-lane metro bus corridor runs through the heart of Lahore along Multan Road, McLeod Road, and GT Road. Upon completion, the Orange Metro Line was expected to have capacity for 30,000 passenger per hour and serve 250,000 passengers per day.   CR-NORINCO — a joint venture of China State Railway Group Co. Ltd. (CR) and China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) — was the entity responsible for project implementation. The project was initially expected to begin by the end of 2014 and last for 27 months (estimated completed date: March 31, 2017). The project was ultimately completed on December 10, 2019. However, it encountered various problems and delays during implementation. The Lahore Development Authority began marking sites for demolition in August 2015, including government buildings, royal tombs, mosques, schools, and residences. Civil works were then initiated by CN-NORINCO on October 25, 2015. Popular protests prompted the Lahore high court to suspend work surrounding heritage sites in January 2016 while the court deliberated the issue. Then, in August 2016, the Lahore high court ruled that the government could not evict people or harm the heritage sites. The Punjab provincial government challenged the ruling, and in April 2017, the Supreme Court reversed its decision, allowing construction to continue under 31 conditions to limit the disruption and damage of the project. Then, in May 2019, a special audit of the project project was submitted to the federal government. The audit revealed losses to the national exchequer and alleged irregularities worth billions of rupees. More specifically, the audit disclosed that no framework agreement existed between the federal and provincial governments and that sub-contractors were granted several contracts without any approval. The audit claimed that a loss of $1,528,000 had been incurred to the national exchequer. It also claimed more than $1.4 million had been spent on the basis of favoritism with regard to project allowance.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank buyer’s credit loan for the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement.

The proceeds from the supplier credit were to be used by the borrower (PT Tanjung Kasam Power) to partially finance the $181 million cost of the EPC contract with China Huadian Engineering Co. Ltd. The borrowing terms of the supplier credit were as follows: a 10-year maturity and a 3 year grace period. The interest rate of the supplier credit is unknown. It is known that the borrower purchased credit insurance from Sinosure. China Huadian Engineering Co. Ltd., in turn, secured an export seller’s credit from China Eximbank in order to finance the supplier credit.   The purpose of the project was to install a 130-megawatt (MW) coal-fired power plant — with two 115MW generators (Unit 1 and Unit 2) — in Telaga Punggur subdistrict within Batam City, Riau Province, Sumatra Island (exact locational coordinates: 1.0441369, 104.1357136). China Huadian Engineering Co. Ltd was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. On August 31, 2010, a formal groundbreaking ceremony was held.  However, construction did not begin until March 1, 2011. The expected duration of the construction period was 28 months. However, the project was completed in 20 months (well ahead of schedule). In February 2013, the Jakarta Post reported that “[a]round 300 residents of Batam, Riau Islands, have rallied to shut down the Tanjung Kasam steam-powered electricity plant (PLTU) until state-owned electricity company PT PLN stops it from pouring ash onto their homes. The residents of Telaga Punggur subdistrict in Nongsa have complained of respiratory and skin ailments due to ash from the plant since the Tanjung Kasam PLTU started operations at the end of 2012.""

The borrowing terms of the GCL are as follows: a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, an interest rate of 2%, a commitment fee of 0.25%, and a management fee of 0.25%. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance a $199 million USD commercial contract with China Harbour Engineering Corporation (CHEC).   The purpose of the project is to construct a new terminal at J.A.

CHEC is the contractor responsible for implementation. In February 2021, the Suriname Ministry of Public Works announced that the project was halted for the time being and under evaluation. No other reasons were were provided about the halting of the project.  However, there are some indications that the China Eximbank loan issued for the .A. Pengel International Airport Expansion Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis lender expectations. The Government of Suriname defaulted on its sovereign debt obligations three times during the COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2021, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that ‘Suriname owes arrears to China and India, which have provided assurances, although less specific than those provided by the Paris Club creditors, that they intend to work with Suriname towards a debt restructuring that will restore sustainability.

On the basis of the Surinamese authorities’ commitment noted above, staff expect that debt to China and India will be treated on comparable terms with other bilateral creditors. The arrears constitute a form of financing contribution to the program. China and India have acknowledged that Suriname will continue to run arrears on their official debt until a debt treatment can be agreed.’ The IMF also disclosed in December 2021 that ‘[t]he stock of external arrears is estimated to be at 11 percent of GDP by end-2021, including arrears of USD 61 million to China.’ Then, in May 2023, the IMF announced the ‘[a]n agreement was reached with Paris Club (PC) creditors for a two-step debt treatment in June 2022, and bilateral agreements with most of the PC creditors have been completed.

The BCL carries the following borrowing terms: a 15.5 year maturity (final maturity date: July 21, 2032) and a 3% interest rate. The proceeds of the BCL are to be used by the borrower to partially finance a 23,394,790,000 Ksh (approximately $230 million) commercial contract with China Hydropower International Co., Ltd.  The lender made disbursements worth $156,960,922.36 prior to July 1, 2021 and disbursements worth $37,195,454.30 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022). The loan’s amount outstanding was $156,960,922.36 as of June 30, 2020, $156,960,922.36 as of June 30, 2021, and $194,156,376.66 as of June 30, 2022.   Phase 1 of the project involves the tarmacking of the 192 km, B7 highway.  The highway begins at the junction with A8 (Nairobi-Mombasa road) near Kibwezi town and runs in a northward direction via Ikutha, Mutomo, Kitui, Kabati and ends at Migwani. Upon completion, it is envisioned that this highway will encourage development of critical infrastructure facilities such as power, water, telecommunications, and social infrastructure in the regions traversed as well as support the long term development and viability of the Mombasa-Isiolo-Moyale corridor, and Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia Transport (LAPSSET) corridor, while linking three more regional transport corridors which are the Northern Corridor (A8), the Kenya-Ethiopia Corridor (A2) and the Thika-Garissa-Liboi (A3).   China Hydropower International Co., Ltd (中水电国际公司) -- also known as Sinohydro -- is the contractor responsible for project implementation.  The Kenya National Highways Authority is responsible for overseeing its work. Construction began on December 6, 2016. The project had achieved a 53% complete rate as of May 2019. Its originally expected completion date was February 15, 2021.   However, the project has encountered major implementation delays due to land acquisition challenges, the relocation of power line alongs the road corridor, delayed payments, a shortage of water for the works, and a temporary suspension of work by contractor due to COVID-19 cases reported in Kitui.

63942,"China (People's Republic of)","Philippines","Asia",2018,NA,"China Eximbank provides $211.2 million preferential buyer's credit for New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam Project","On October 20, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Philippines signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on financing cooperation. Then, on November 15, 2017, the two parties signed a financing cooperation agreement on the New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam Project. The Government of Philippines’ National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Investment Coordination Committee approved the project on April 25, 2018. Approximately five months later, on September 21, 2018, the Government of Philippines submitted a loan application to China Eximbank.   Then, on November 20, 2018, China Eximbank and the Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) — a government agency in the Philippines that is in charge of water privatization in Metro Manila — signed a $211,214,646.54 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [No.I420I0300202018213220 and CHINA EXIMBANK PBC 2018 NO.25 TOTAL NO.48] for the New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC are as follows: a 20-year maturity period, a 7-year grace period, an interest rate of 2%, a default (penalty) interest rate of 0%, a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee ($633,643.94). The loan effectiveness date was on November 1, 2019, and MWSS paid the entire management fee ($633,643.94) to China Eximbank on November 26, 2019. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a PHP 12,189,893,798.70 commercial (EPC) contract [No.NCWS-KDP 001-2018] between MWSS and China Energy Engineering Corporation Limited (CEEC).   The purpose of the project is to construct the Kaliwa Dam, including intake facilities and other facilities, and a 57 million cubic meter reservoir. The project involves the construction of a water conveyance tunnel that is expected to supply 2,400 million liters per day of raw water for Metro Manila, thereby reducing dependence on the Angat Dam reservoir. Upon completion, the project is also expected to benefit some 17.46 million people or about 3.49 million households of Metro Manila, Rizal, and Quezon. The Kaliwa dam is located in the municipalities of General Nakar and Infanta in Quezon Province and the municipality of Teresa in Rizal Province.   CEEC is the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. EDCOP, PRIMEX, and SMEC are also involved in the project as subcontractors. An environmental compliance certificate (ECC) [No. ECC-CO-1907-0017] for the project was issued by the Government of the Philippines’ Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) on October 11, 2019. But DENR Undersecretary Benny Antiporda was quoted as saying that “the ECC was issued because it was a priority project of the government and the agency had no recourse but to approve it.” A notice to proceed was issued to the EPC contractor on November 13, 2019.   By May 2020, there were only a few more kilometers of access road (to the planned reservoir in General Nakar town in Quezon) left to construct to reach the main dam site. As of December 31, 2020, the project had achieved a 2.48% completion rate. As of March 2021, it had achieved a 9.44% completion rate. Then, on June 29, 2021, a formal groundbreaking ceremony took place.    A June 2021 report quoted MWSS as saying that tunnel excavation for the Kaliwa Dam would be ready to begin in December 2021, with the planned arrival of the tunnel boring machine to the Port of Manila slated for July 2021. Construction continued throughout 2021, despite the fact that the project did not have permits from the appropriate government agencies, opened up the possibility that the ECC issued for the project would be revoked. According to the Commission on Audit (COA), MWSS and CEEC must first comply with the requirements of the National Integrated Protected Areas Systems Act and have a certification issued by the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples. It must also identify disposal sites of excavated materials, among others. If these requirements are not met, the COA has warned that the ECC may be cancelled, which would jeopardize the loan agreement with China Eximbank and the commercial contract with CEEC. The project has generated a great deal of local criticism, with some people warning that the dam could destroy the ecosystems and habitats of indigenous people in several Quezon province towns.   After granting the project’s ECC, the Government of the Philippines downplayed the threat of a sizable flood occurring in the case of structural damage to the dam caused by an earthquake. Public officials claimed that there are no active faults near the dam. The New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam Project also threatens to displace up to 10,000 members of the Dumagat-Remontado indigenous people group who live in the project area. These Dumagat communities depend on farming for a majority of their income as well as working for Sierra Madre hikers. The loss of their farmland leaves their economic future uncertain. The project site is also the location of sites sacred to the Dumagat people. The Government of the Philippines claims that only 46 families stand to be affected by the project.   In March 2019, Marcelino Tena, President of Samahan ng mga Katutubong Agta-Dumagat-Remontado na Binabaka at Ipinagtatanggol ang Lupaing Ninuno (SAGIBIN-LN), alleged that MWSS “did not follow the right process to secure the Free, Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC),” adding that the engineering design had not been shown to them. In contrast, then-MWSS administrator Reynaldo Velasco claimed that only about 46 families would be affected, that several consultations with those who would be affected had been made, and that the project design had yet to be finalized. The controversy led to the creation of the “STOP Kaliwa Dam” (SKD) organization. Also known as Sectors and Peoples Totally Opposed to Kaliwa Dam, the organization claims representation from indigenous peoples, local communities, church leaders, academics, environmentalists, and social movements. The group has started a signature campaign from all over the Philippines to petition Duterte to stop the project.   By September 2019, the official MWSS website reported that three successful public hearings initiated by DENR-EMB and the MWSS had been conducted, as follows: at General Nakar, Quezon on August 23, 2019, at Teresa, Rizal on August 27, 2019; and at Infanta, Quezon on August 28, 2019. In connection with the free, prior, and informed consent, the site has this to say: “With regard to MWSS’ compliance with Republic Act No. 8173 or the Indigenous People’s Rights Acts, the MWSS through the National Commission of Indigenous Peoples has successfully completed the community assemblies on the six (6) clusters of IP communities in Quezon Province as part of the Free Prior and Informed Consent (FPIC) process (emphasis supplied).” However, according to Mavic Conde, five out of six cluster communities in General Nakar—one of the two municipalities in Quezon province where the NCWS-KDP will be located (the other one is Infanta)— voted overwhelmingly no, effectively rejecting the project. The five clusters consist of those in Lumutan, Baybay, Pasanghan, Umiray, and Cablao.   Also, Aaron Pedrosa, attorney for the progressive political party Sanlakas, alleged that MWSS failed to provide proof of compliance with the procedural requirement of posting a public notice and a copy of the scoping report as proof that public scoping was conducted in the area as part of the environmental impact study. These allegations and counter-allegations have given rise to serious legal questions relating to the issuance of the ECC in the absence of a valid consultation process.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Private Sector|Recipient Private Sector|Other Private Sector",230192229.279902,"The project aims to develop a 57 million cubic meter reservoir that will supply 600 million liters of water daily to the Metro Manila region.

53565,"China (People's Republic of)","Sri Lanka","Asia",2016,NA,"China Development Bank provides $195 million loan for Gampaha, Attanagalla, and Miniwangoda Integrated Water Supply Project","The National Water Supply and Drainage Board of Sri Lanka (NWSDB) received an unsolicited conceptual proposal from China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) to implement the Gampaha, Attanagalla, Minuwangoda Integrated Water Supply Scheme (GAMWSS) in 2010, along with a letter of intent issued by China Development Bank (CDB) to grant a credit line for GAMWSS and an endorsement letter issued by the Chinese Embassy. A Project Assessment Committee (PAC) subsequently reviewed the conceptual proposal submitted by CMEC in June 2010. In its report, the PAC noted that CMEC had limited experience with water supply projects and the qualifications listed were that of an associate company, the Tianjin Water Industry Engineering & Equipment Co. Ltd (TWIEE). Hence, the PAC noted that the project should only be implemented jointly by both these companies. The NWSDB submitted the project concept note for the approval of the Government of Sri Lanka’s National Planning Department (NPD) and Standing Cabinet Appointed Review Committee (SCARC) in July 2010. The total cost of the project which was submitted for NPD approval in July 2010 was just LKR 10,675 million ($94 million), which amounted to just 32% of the final contracted value of the project (which was LKR 33,060 million or $229.5 million). Based on the recommendation by SCARC, Sri Lanka’s Cabinet of Ministers approved the request for technical and financial proposals from CMEC on July 31, 2010.   Sri Lanka’s Ministry of Water Supply and Drainage (MOWSD) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the CMEC on November 15, 2010. According to the MOU, CMEC was to submit the technical and financial proposals by January 31, 2011. The MOU does not refer to funding from CDB, and states instead that the parties will support each other to secure ‘preferably a concessional loan from EXIM Bank of China’, which suggests that the initial funding offer from the CDB had been rejected during the approval process and a request had been made to secure a loan from China Eximbank in its place. It also indicates that at the time of signing the MOU, there was no firm commitment from China Eximbank to provide funding for the project. Despite the lack of a firm commitment on funding, and without having seen technical and financial proposals from CMEC, the MOWSD agreed in the MOU not to ‘solicit or initiate any proposals or respond to any proposals from any other party’ for the implementation of the project. According to the MOU, this commitment remains valid (unless both parties agree in writing to withdraw from the project) up to 77 days from the date of signing the MOU and can be further extended if there had been delays attributable to either party.   The Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) that reviewed the technical and financial proposals received from CMEC submitted its report on July 31, 2012. The initial price quoted by CMEC was $258 million, 50% higher than the total cost estimate (TCE) of the project prepared by NWSDB engineers of $172 million. This engineer’s estimate had factored in a 25% profit margin for the contractor as well. The TEC noted that the CMEC had quoted very high prices for certain civil works and in order to reduce these costs, the NWSDB agreed to undertake the implementation of these civil work items including the Basnagoda reservoir as a sub-contractor. The price quoted by the CMEC for this component was $72 million and NWSDB agreed to complete this work for $64 million, resulting in a saving of $8 million. By the time the MOWSD submitted a memorandum to the Cabinet of Ministers on September 3, 2012, the contract price had been further reduced to $232.5 million. This was still 35.2% higher than the TCE prepared by the NWSDB engineers which already had a 25% profit margin factored into it.   The Strategic Enterprise Management Agency (SEMA), an organization tasked with ensuring that SOEs and statutory boards such as the NWSDB are sustainably managed, requested the government to reconsider awarding the contract to CMEC. SEMA noted in its observations that CMEC has already caused numerous problems for the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) as the primary contractor of the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant. SCARC appears to have conducted a second round of negotiations with the contractor — in response to a request made by the Cabinet of Ministers on September 26, 2012 — to further reduce the gap between TCE and the contract price. During the meeting SCARC held on October 10, 2012, the TCE was first increased from $172 million to $197 million considering the inflation due to the delay in the project start year from 2012 to 2014 (the original TCE had assumed that the project would commence in 2012). The TCE was further increased from $197 million to $216.7 million considering the potential future appreciation of the Chinese yuan (RMB) against the US dollar (USD). The SCARC, noting that the original TCE by the engineers had factored in a 25% profit margin, had requested that CMEC reduce its contract price from $232.5 million to $216.7 million. However, CMEC refused to do so citing the rapid appreciation of the RMB and the price reduction already made from $258 million to $232.5 million. CMEC agreed to bring down the contract price to $229.5 million. Following this meeting held on the October 10, 2012, the SCARC made a recommendation to the Cabinet of Ministers to award the contract to CMEC for $229.49 million.   On May 9, 2013, the Cabinet gave its approval to award the contract to CMEC based on the recommendation of the SCARC and instructed the Ministry and the External Resources Department (ERD) to work towards obtaining a preferential buyers’ credit (PBC) from China Eximbank to fund the project. On May 15, 2013, the NWSDB signed the commercial contract with CMEC for the implementation of GAMWSS, agreeing to pay CMEC for the design, execution and completion of the works a sum of $229.49 million. CMEC signed a sub-contract with NWSDB for the Civil Works and the Basnagoda Reservoir on October 6, 2014. Then, on August 29, 2016, China Development Bank (CDB) and the Government of Sri Lanka signed a $195,075,000 (approximately Rs. 28.4 billion) loan agreement for the Gampaha, Attanagalla, and Miniwangoda Integrated Water Supply Project. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15 year maturity, a 3 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.95% margin, and a commitment fee of 0.5%. The borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $229.49 million commercial contract [ID#P&P/DB/CHINA EXIM/GAMIWS S/2013/01], which was signed with China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) on May 15, 2013. The remaining 15 percent ($34.5 million) was borrowed from Bank of Ceylon, a state-owned commercial bank in Sri Lanka, on January 16, 2017.   The purpose of the project is to provide safe and reliable drinking water to the areas of the Gampaha, Minuwangoda, and Attanagalla Divisional Secretariat (DS) divisions and part of Meerigama Divisional Secretariat (DS) division. The project involves the construction of a Basnagoda 3.5 MCM capacity impounding reservoir at Karasnagala, the construction of a 85,000 m3/day capacity water intake facility at Karasnagala, the construction of a 54,000 m3/day capacity Water Treatment Plant (WTP) at Karasnagala, the construction of a wastewater and sludge treatment facility including all accessories and pumping equipment at the treatment plant premises, the construction of 10,000 m3 capacity High Level Reservoir (HLR) at Nikahetikanda, the construction of five 1,500 m3 capacity elevated water towers at Ranpokunugama, Belummahara, Naiwala, Minuwangoda and Pasyala, the supply and laying of 1,000 mm diameter Ductile Iron (DI) pipes for raw water pumping main of 1.75 km length approximately from the water intake to the WTP, the supply and laying of 1,000 mm dia. DI pipes for treated water pumping main of 1.65 km length approximately from the WTP to the high-level reservoir (HLR), the supply and laying of 1,100 mm dia. to 150mm dia. range DI pipes for the gravity transmission main approximate length of 89.2 km from the HLR to existing and new water towers, supply and laying of 225 mm dia. to 90 mm dia. range uPVC pipes for the distribution network, approximate length of 600 km, supply and laying of 400 mm dia. to 300 mm dia. range DI pipes for balance part of the distribution network, approximate length of 30 km, and finally catchment protection. In total, the project seeks to build a 720 km water pipe network. Upon completion, the project is expected to provide about 600,000 residents in Gampaha, Attanagalla and Minuwangoda with clean drinking water.  Tianjin Municipal Engineering Design & Research Institute is responsible for project design and China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) is the contractor responsible for project implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on December 5, 2014 (prior to loan approval). However, project implementation did not commence until February 2017. As of January 31, 2018, the Sri Lankan Department of Project Management and Monitoring reported that the project had achieved a ‘physical progress’ rate of 20.27%. As of December 2018, the project has achieved a ‘physical progress’ rate of approximately 50%. As of early 2021, the project had achieved a ‘physical progress’ rate of 68.9%. Although the project was originally scheduled to reach completion in February 2020, the scheduled project completion date was subsequently revised to February 2022 due to various implementation delays.  This project has been plagued by controversy. In May 2018, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga demanded that this project be suspended and investigated on the grounds that it was overpriced. Even while the Rajapaksa administration was still in power, a Cabinet-appointed procurement committee noticed a major difference between the cost estimated by the NWSDB engineers for pipe laying and other activities and the higher prices estimated by CMEC. However, a review committee set up after the 2015 change of government recommended the continuation of the project. The Auditor General’s (AG) Department also raised concerns about the qualifications of CMEC to undertake such a major project. It noted that the company’s portfolio showed no specialization in water supply projects and that in the experience section of CMEC’s project proposal it listed the experience of several other companies (China National Machinery Import and Export Cooperation and Tianjin Water Industry Engineering and Equipment Co. Ltd.). The AG Department also highlighted that even though government procurement guidelines state that only a maximum of 20 percent can be paid as an advance to a contractor, an advance payment of 34 percent was made to CMEC. Then, in a letter dated May 17, 2018, to the Secretary of the Treasury, Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunge, the Attorney General recommended that a complaint be filed at the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption (CIABOC) since it appeared that the project was mired in graft.   This project has also encountered debt repayment problems. On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a ‘pre-emptive’ sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. Its decision to suspend external debt service reportedly affected all China Development Bank loans with amounts outstanding at the time of the announcement. As of March 2023, the Government of Sri Lanka had accumulated $338 million in arrears to China Development Bank.","Implementation","Development","Loan","ODA-like","WATER SUPPLY AND SANITATION","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company",230345439.468027,"The National Water Supply and Drainage Board of Sri Lanka (NWSDB) received an unsolicited conceptual proposal from China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) to implement the Gampaha, Attanagalla, Minuwangoda Integrated Water Supply Scheme (GAMWSS) in 2010.

This loan carries a maturity of 14 years and an interest rate of LIBOR plus 190 basis points. The interest rate is calculated using the average 6-month LIBOR of 1.626% from November 2017 plus 190 basis points = 3.526%. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) reportedly contributed $200 million to this loan syndicate. Other funders were Mizuho Bank, Ltd., the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), African Development Bank and other eight private financial institutions.   The purpose of the project is to construct the railway and port infrastructure that is needed to transport and export coal produced from the Moatize coal mine in Mozambique. It involves the construction of a 912 km railway that connects the Moatize coal mine developed by Vale S.A. and Mitsui & Co, Ltd. in Tete to the port of Nacala through part of Malawi. The railway has three sections: (1) the Nacala-to-Velha section that connects the village of Andre Mossuril to the town of Nacala-a-Velha; (2) the Lumbo section that connects the city of Monapo to the port village of Lumbo; and (3) the Cuamba-Lichinga section that connects the town of Cuamba to the city of Lichinga. The project also involves the construction of an export terminal and a coal storage yard at the port of Nacala-a-Velha. Upon completion, the project will facilitate rail and ship transport of produced coal up to a volume of 18 million tons per annum. China Communications Construction Group Ltd. was one of the contractors involved in that implementation of this project. A groundbreaking ceremony for this project took place on May 12, 2017.

The purpose of the project is to replace 1593 km of track along the Belgrano Freight Railway, which stretches from Retiro station in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires through a total of 14 Argentine provinces: Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, Córdoba, San Luis, Mendoza, San Juan, La Rioja, Catamarca, Tucumán, Santiago del Estero, Chaco, Formosa, Salta, and Jujuy. The rail network even connects with two neighboring countries: one of its branches links with Chile through the Socompa border crossing in Salta province, continuing to the port of Antofagasta on the Pacific. There are two alternative connections with Bolivia, neither of which are currently operating. The first is through La Quiaca in Jujuy province, the second through Salvador Mazza in Salta province. The project also involves the acquisition of 1000 wagons and 30 locomotives. These activities will be implemented as part of the Argentine government’s Belgrano Plan, which is a set of transportation, infrastructure, production, health, employment, housing, and education policies and programs that target the country's northern provinces.   The rail replacement work is scheduled to take place in three phases. Work on the first phase will cover 535 km and it includes the Santurce-Tostado-Chorotis-Las Breñas section, the Pampa del Infierno-Los Frentones section, and the Los Pirpintos-Los Tigres-Taco Pozo sections in Santa Fe, Chaco, and Santiago del Estero provinces. Work on the second phase is 500 km in length and it includes the Coronda-Santo Tomé and Laguna Paiva-Naré sections, both in Santa Fe province, and Talavera-Pichanal-Embarcación-Chalicán, between Salta and Jujuy. The third phase of the project is 558 km in length and it includes refurbishment of the Tucumán-Metán-Joaquín V. González and Metán-Chalicán sections in Tucumán, Salta, and Jujuy provinces. These activities are expected to generate 23,000 jobs, including both direct and indirect employment. The project implies major logistical work, including the transportation of more than 2 million sleepers, 170,000 tons of rail, and 5 million tons of ballast stone.   CMEC is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, China South Locomotive & Rolling Stock Corporation (CSR) and CRRC Qishuyan —a subsidiary of the CRRC Corporation Limited —are also involved in the project as subcontractors.   An official project commencement ceremony took place on July 18, 2014. However, construction activities did not begin until December 2014. The project was originally expected to reach completion within two years (December 2016). CMEC had delivered 107 locomotives and 2500 carriages by February 2017.  Then, in January 2018, locomotives manufactured by China's CRRC Qishuyan arrived in Argentina. On May 31, 2019, President Macri attended the inauguration ceremony of the first 700 km of renewed railway tracks of the Belgrano Cargas train in the town of Joaquin V. Gonzalez in Salta province. As of May 2022, the project had achieved a 77.96% completion rate.  The Belgrano Cargas Railway Line Rehabilitation Project was at risk of cancellation and loan default in 2016. On July 18, 2014, Argentina’s Ministry of Economy and Public Finance signed a $4,714,350,000 syndicated term loan facility agreement with three Chinese state-owned banks (Bank of China, China Development Bank, and ICBC) for the construction of two hydroelectric dams (the so-called Kirchner-Cepernic dams) on the Santa Cruz River in Patagonia. The loan agreement included a cross-default clause, stating that if the borrower canceled the project, CDB financing for a separate project (the $2,099,965,834 loan for the Belgrano Cargas Railway Line Project) would also be cancelled. In November 2015, newly elected Argentine President Mauricio Macri announced his intention to suspend the construction of the Kirchner-Cepernic dams. These dams are located on the Santa Cruz River near the famous Perito Moreno Glacier (UNESCO World Heritage Site) that feeds from the same river, and the Macri administration considered these dams to be too risky on environmental grounds. When President Macri first announced his intention to suspend the project, CDB, ICBC, and Bank of China had already disbursed $950 million under the syndicated term loan agreement.   Then, on March 10, 2016, CDB sent a warning letter to Argentina's Finance Minister, Alfonso Prat Gay, The letter said: ""The Kirchner-Cepernic dams and the Belgrano Cargas are major projects promoted by the Chinese Communist Party and signed during the same political time period in Argentina and each one of the ... facility agreements contain cross-default clauses."" The Macri administration subsequently reversed course and announced that it no longer intended to suspend construction of the Nestor Kirchner and Jorge Cepernic Hydroelectric Dams.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Commercial Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company",234824711.585169,"The Belgrano Freight Railway stretches from Retiro station in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires through a total of 14 Argentine provinces: Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, Córdoba, San Luis, Mendoza, San Juan, La Rioja, Catamarca, Tucumán, Santiago del Estero, Chaco, Formosa, Salta, and Jujuy.

Borrowings through the line of credit were to be used for the development of infrastructure and resource projects in Kazakhstan. Then, on October 13, 2009, KAZ Minerals PLC (also known as ‘Kazakhmys Corporation LLC’ and ‘Kazakhmys’) announced that it was in discussions with CDB and Samruk-Kazyna regarding a major unsecured loan facility. Following a memorandum of financial cooperation that was signed by Kazakhmys, Samruk-Kazyna and CDB on November 14, 2009, $2.7 billion from the $3 billion line of credit was allocated to various projects of KAZ Minerals PLC. Then, on December 30, 2009, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC (also known as Kazakhmys Finance PLC) — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of KAZ Minerals PLC — and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $2 billion facility (loan) agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project. On the same day, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $100 million facility (loan) agreement for the Bozymchak Copper and Gold Mine Development Project. Thirteen days later, on January 12, 2010, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project. Then, on June 11, 2012, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed two additional loan agreements: a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All five loan agreements (collectively worth $2.7 billion) were financed by Samruk-Kazyna via borrowings from the $3 billion CDB line of credit.  All of the loans carried the following borrowing terms: maturities of between 12 and 15 years (with final maturity dates falling between January 2022 and August 2025), 3 year grace periods (with the first loan repayment scheduled for January 2013), annual interest rates of LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin, and 1.5% management fees. A separate fee of $3 million was also payable under the loan agreements for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Project and the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All of the loans were also backed by repayment guarantees from KAZ Minerals PLC and a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna. All five loans reportedly disbursed in full by January 2013. The remaining $300 million under the $3 billion CDB line of credit was utilized (drawn down) by Samruk-Kazyna for an unknown purposes and fully repaid in January 2013. In January 2014, KAZ Minerals PLC fully repaid its loans for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project (since the development of these projects was no longer expected to commence in the near future). Then, on December 29, 2014, two of the loan agreements that KAZ Minerals Finance PLC had previously signed with Samruk-Kazyna (via on-lending from the CDB line of credit) were transformed into bilateral loan agreements with CDB: the loan agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project and the loan agreement for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project. At that time, the face value of the loan for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project was $1,844,000,000 (most likely because some repayments were made between January 2013 and December 2014) and the face value of the loan for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project was upsized to $148,500,000 (for an unknown reason). At that time the borrowing, terms of the two loans with outstanding balances were rescheduled.  The interest rate was lowered from LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin to LIBOR plus a 4.50% margin; and an arrangement fee of 0.5% was agreed upon, of which 60% was paid in December 2014 and 40% was paid in January 2016. The maturities and grace periods of the loan were left unchanged. KAZ Minerals PLC continued to serve as a guarantor for the loans. However, as an additional credit enhancement, the borrower pledged a $100,000,000 minimum cash balance in a charge account (collection account) as a source of collateral. The amended, bilateral loan (facility) agreements between CDB and KAZ Minerals also clarified that the loan proceeds were to be used by the borrower ‘principally for the development of the Bozshakol and Bozymchak [mine] projects.’ As of December 31, 2020, $1.0 billion was drawn down by the borrower under the $1,844,000,000 CDB loan agreement and the $148,500,000 CDB loan agreement. During 2020, the borrower made a $183 million repayment. An additional $181 million repayment was due in 2021. Both CDB loans are repayable in semi-annual installments each January and July with final maturity dates in August 2025.

Borrowings through the line of credit were to be used for the development of infrastructure and resource projects in Kazakhstan. Then, on October 13, 2009, KAZ Minerals PLC (also known as ‘Kazakhmys Corporation LLC’ and ‘Kazakhmys’) announced that it was in discussions with CDB and Samruk-Kazyna regarding a major unsecured loan facility. Following a memorandum of financial cooperation that was signed by Kazakhmys, Samruk-Kazyna and CDB on November 14, 2009, $2.7 billion from the $3 billion line of credit was allocated to various projects of KAZ Minerals PLC. Then, on December 30, 2009, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC (also known as Kazakhmys Finance PLC) — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of KAZ Minerals PLC — and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $2 billion facility (loan) agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project. On the same day, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $100 million facility (loan) agreement for the Bozymchak Copper and Gold Mine Development Project. Thirteen days later, on January 12, 2010, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project.

The Xeset II head pond collects the flow from both the Xeset and the Houay Tapoung diversion which then enters the head pond on the bank of the Xeset. The project consisted of a concrete overflow dam (114 m long x 23 m high) with an intake structure and two radial flushing gates. The head pond has an active volume of 800,000 m³ which is to be used for daily peaking. The intake is situated on the right bank of head pond and leads to a 1.5 km long open canal with a gated intake, trash rack and trash rack cleaner, a 6.8 km long headrace tunnel with a 19.67 m2 to 26.30 m2 cross section, a 1.49 km long steel penstock, a surface powerhouse and a 200 m long tailrace. A vertical surface venting surge tank is located just upstream of the steel penstock. The combined catchment area for the Xeset II Hydropower Project is 392 km². The powerhouse discharge is 33.7m³/s.   The powerhouse is designed to drain to the Xeset 1 head pond via a 200 m long tailrace. Access to the powerhouse and associated switchyard was to be linked to both the 115kV transmission line to Paksong and connect to Xeset 1 switch yard by a 115 kV line. The Xeset II powerhouses were to be connected via a 37 km long double-circuit 115kV transmission line from the switch yard of Xeset II to Paksong. This was to be linked to the southern supply area at Chiengxai (Ban Jianjxay) Substation. The linkage was designed to increase reliability and guaranteed electricity supply to the southern Lao and the EGAT Grid System in Thailand. A 3.1 km long 115kV transmission line was also to link the switch yards between Xeset II and Xeset 1. The Chiengxai substation was to be be connected to Bangyo substation which is in turn connected to the EGAT Grid.

64786,"China (People's Republic of)","Lao People's Democratic Republic","Asia",2017,NA,"CDB provides $215 million buyer’s credit loan for Vientiane Power Grid Modernization Project","On November 13, 2017, China Development and the Government of Laos signed a $215 million buyer’s credit loan agreement for the Vientiane Power Grid Modernization Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 90% of the cost of a $239 million commercial (EPC) contract between Huazhong Power International Economic and Trade Co., Ltd. — a subsidiary of China Electric Power Technology Equipment Co., Ltd. — and Electricite du Laos (EDL), which was signed in December 2015. EDL is considered to be the project owner.   The purpose of the project is to reconstruct the 115 kV Donekoy substation (ສະ​ຖາ​ນີ​ໄຟ​ຟ້າ​ດອນກອຍ), the 115 kV Sokpaluang substation (ສະຖານີໄຟຟ້າໂສກປ່າຫລວງ), and the transmission line works (a 40 km 230kV line and a 50 km 500kV line) between the two substations in the capital city of Vientiane.   Huazhong Power International Economic and Trade Co., Ltd. is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Project implementation commenced on April 19, 2019. The project is still under implementation; but on July 24, 2021, the first station of the Laos substation was put online. The expected completion date of the project is April 2022.  There are some indications that the CDB loan for the Vientiane Power Grid Modernization Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. Laos’ gross foreign exchange reserves were dangerously low between 2019 and 2021, hovering between 1.4 and 2.3 months of import cover, and total public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt increased from 68 percent of GDP ($12.5 billion) in 2019 to 88 percent in 2021 of GDP (or $14.5 billion). According to a report published by the World Bank in April 2022, ‘[t]he energy sector, mostly represented by Électricité du Laos (EDL), accounted for over 30 percent of total PPG debt in 2021. […] EDL’s debt service obligations [were] still unsustainable [at the time], with future debt service accounting for about two fifths of EDL’s total operating revenue.’ The Laotian authorities sought and secured debt service payment deferrals from their Chinese creditors in 2020 and 2021; according to the World Bank, ‘[d]ebt service deferrals granted by major lenders in 2020-2021 amounted around 3.6 percent of GDP in 2021’ and ’[a]s a result, actual debt service payments are estimated to have declined to 48 percent of total revenues in 2021, compared to 65 percent in the 2021 [Government of Laos] plan.’  The country’s central bank (Bank of the Lao P.D.R) also made a $300 million drawdown under its currency swap agreement with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in June 2020 — when its gross reserves stood at only 1.5 months of import cover and credit rating agencies warned of a high default probability. Then, in 2021, the short-term emergency loan from the PBOC was ‘rolled over’ for another year. Around the same time, a Chinese state-owned enterprise purchased a major public infrastructure asset in Laos—a large part of the country’s electricity transmission grid—from EDL as part of an apparent debt-for-equity swap. China Southern Power Grid Co. and EDL established a joint venture known as Électricité du Laos Transmission Company Limited (EDLT) in September 2020.  China Southern Power Grid Co. purchased a 90% ownership stake in EDLT in exchange for a $600 million fee (equity infusion). Then, in March 2021, EDLT signed a 25-year concession agreement, which made it responsible for management of the country’s high-voltage transmission network above 230 kilovolts. Independent observers suggested at the time that EDL would likely use the $600 million upfront payment from China Southern Power Grid Co. to service its outstanding debts to Chinese creditors, although this has not been independently confirmed. According to the World Bank’s International Debt Statistics, the Government of Laos was responsible for making average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $232 million between 2019 and 2019 and average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $60 million between 2020 and 2021 (a substantially lower figure due to payment deferrals); however, it expected to make average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth nearly $678 million over the next seven years (2022-2028).","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient State-owned Company",247752703.759509,"The purpose of the project is to reconstruct the 115 kV Donekoy substation (ສະ​ຖາ​ນີ​ໄຟ​ຟ້າ​ດອນກອຍ), the 115 kV Sokpaluang substation (ສະຖານີໄຟຟ້າໂສກປ່າຫລວງ), and the transmission line works (a 40 km 230kV line and a 50 km 500kV line) between the two substations in the capital city of Vientiane.

However, the project was finished ahead of schedule on May 27, 2018.  On July 22, 2018, the Barapukuria coal-fired power plant was shut down after the discovery of the “Barapukuria coal scam”, which was a corruption scandal concerning the misappropriation of around 142 hundred thousand tons of coal, worth over BDT 227 billion by officials of Barapukuria Coal Mining Company Limited (BCMCL) from the coal mine of Barapukuria, Dinajpur District, in northern Bangladesh. The scandal was revealed in July 2018 when a board member of the Bangladesh Power Development Board went to visit the coal mine and found no fresh coal whereas according to the document there should have been around 142 hundred thousand tons of coal reserved. The matter came to light when a Bangladeshi English-language daily reported the incident.   Petrobangla, the parent organization of the BCMCL, promptly suspended a few officials in this connection while the Anti-Corruption Commission started an inquiry to trace the corruption. Barapukuria's coal-fired power plant suspended its operations due to the shortage of coal as an immediate effect of the corruption scandal. Before the shutdown of the plant, it had been supplying around 380MW power to the national grid on an average. When the power plant shut down the first time, the people of eight northern districts of Rangpur and Dinajpur regions suffered from a lack of electricity.

The railway begins at Sebeta, just outside of Ethiopia's capital of Addis Ababa. The city is served by two stations in its southern outskirts, at Furi-Labu and Indode. The line then runs southeast to Modjo and Adama, both towns located in the Ethiopian Great Rift Valley. At Modjo, a railway junction exists for the planned Modjo–Hawassa Railway. In addition, at Modjo the railway is connected to the Modjo Dry Port, Ethiopia's most important inland dry port and also Ethiopia's main hub for domestic and international freight services. At Adama, the railway turns northeast towards Dire Dawa. At Awash, there is a junction with the Awash–Hara Gebeya Railway, which is under construction as of 2018. Directly after Awash station, the line crosses 60 meters above the Awash River canyon over a 155 meter long bridge, the main bridge of the railway.The railway then proceeds to Dire Dawa, where it turns and heads directly for Djibouti. Crossing the Ethiopia-Djibouti border between Dewale and Ali Sabieh, the line reaches the Djibouti passenger terminal at Nagad railway station, near Djibouti–Ambouli International Airport. In February 2001; the Government of Ethiopia asked CCECC to inspect the line and propose a construction plan. This plan was put on hold for several years due to a lack of funding. After years of continued deterioration due to mismanagement, a 2007 pre-feasibility study indicated that the line needed to be renovated (at a cost of approximately $3.4 billion. The proposed renovation of the railway was designed to include a double track from Addis Ababa to Adama, a single track from Adama to Dewele, a 1035 meter long bridge, the grand bridge at DK42, the 155 meter Awash grand bridge, and a Labu station upgrade. Upon completion, it was envisaged that the Yaji Railway would run passenger trains (at 120 km/hr) and cargo trains (at 80 km/hr).   * Project Implementation:  Construction began in 2012 and the project as a whole had achieved a 50% completion rate by 2014.  Track laying for the railway began in May 2015.  The railway was opened for passenger services on October 4, 2016. Then, on December 31, 2017, Ethiopian Railway Company issued a project handover certificate to CREC and CCECC. The next day, on January 1, 2018, a ceremony was held to mark the beginning of the railway’s commercial operations. Two days later, in January 3, 2018, a two-way passenger train on the Ethiopian section of the railway went into service.  The Yali Railway was the first overseas railway constructed by Chinese enterprises that adhered to international standards (1,435 mm gauge line and electrification at 25 kV) and used Chinese equipment (CSR Zhuzhou for the rolling stock). The Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was originally scheduled (under the terms of the EPC contract) to commence on February 12, 2012 and reach completion within 42 months (August 12, 2015). It was ultimately completed about 15 months behind schedule (November 12, 2016). The Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was originally scheduled (under the terms of the EPC contract) to commence on April 12, 2012 and reach completion within 42 months (October 12, 2015). It was ultimately completed about 14 months behind schedule (December 12, 2016). The Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project was implemented between 2013 and 2015. In April 2014, three diesel locomotives manufactured by arrived in Ethiopia by sea. Then, in October 2015, the ERC took delivery of 315 locomotives — that carry passengers and freight —  from NORINCO and Metals and Engineering Corporation. On December 13, 2015, 22 electric locomotives, 6 diesel locomotives and 6 passenger carriages arrived in the Port of Djibouti.   * Railway Operations & Management (Project Supervision and Control): On July 28, 2016, CREC and CCECC signed the Ethiopia-Djibouti Railway Operation and Management Agreement. The agreement specified that the CREC-CCECC consortium (also known as the CCECC-CREC JV and 中土集团与中铁二局亚吉铁路联营体公司) would manage the railway for 5 years (following construction completion). Then, on December 16, 2015, ERC and Société Djiboutienne de Chemin de Fer (SDCF) established a joint venture called the Ethio-Djibouti Standard Gauge Railway Company (EDR). ERC holds a 75% ownership stake and SDCF holds a 25% ownership stake in EDR. The main purpose of the EDR is to manage the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway (including the maintenance and renewal of all infrastructure and equipment) and to operate freight and passenger transport services on the line from 2024. The December 16, 2015 agreement specified that  CREC and CCECC would operate and maintain the railway for six years from the launch of operations and provide two additional years of technical support during the gradual handover of management duties to EDR from 2024.  * Financial Performance Problems: The project has faced financial problems associated with lower traffic volumes than predicted in the transport forecast and currency exchange rate fluctuations (as the project’s debt was issued in USD, but construction and operation costs, as well as revenues, are denominated in Ethiopian Birr or ETB).  It remains to be seen if the Yali Railway will find a path to commercial viability. The price of a railway passenger ticket was initially set at 30 Ethiopian birr (ETB). However, this price was subsequently deemed too high and reduced to 4 ETB, which means that the railway will generate substantially less ticket revenue than originally planned. Sinosure has reportedly written off $1 billion in losses due to the poor commercial performance of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway. In 2018, the Government of Ethiopia and China Eximbank agreed to restructure the project debt through a 20-year maturity extension and a 4-year grace period extension (see Project ID#61941).  The Government of Djibouti also requested a restructuring of its $491,793,000 buyer's credit loan agreement with China Eximbank for the 100 km Ali Sabieh to Nagad Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project on December 31, 2017.  The Djiboutian authorities reported to the IMF that a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed in 2019 to extend the grace period from 5 years to 10 years, extend maturity of the loan from 15 years to 25 years, and reduce the interest rate from 3.409% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 3% [300 basis points]) to 2.509% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 2.1% [210 basis points]). The Djiboutian authorities also indicated that arrears on interest payments on this loan that had been accumulated during the restructuring discussion (worth 1.2 percent of the country’s GDP) had been restructured—and that they were integrated to the principal and expected to be repaid over the extended amortization period The new terms of the loan reportedly reduced the present value of the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio by 4 percentage points and smoothed total debt service. However, the final loan restructuring agreement (captured via Project ID#85163) was not signed until September 2, 2020. It not only codified the terms and conditions that were first specified in the 2019 MOU, but also sought to improve the performance and profitability of the railway in order to increase revenue generation. The restructuring agreement was ratified into Djiboutian law in February 2021.    * Operational Performance Problems:  Energy supply is not always stable in Ethiopia, due to the variable level of water in the country’s dams. The lack of stable energy supply delayed the start of railway operations, even after construction was complete.  ‘Overvoltage’ problems also led to repeated service interruptions after the railway began commercial operations in early 2018. This is a technical problem where surges in the electrical grid (due to Ethiopia exporting power to its neighbors) lead to overvoltage in the railway transmission line, akin to blowing a fuse. The railway line has also been flooded on several occasions, halting or delaying services. The Ethiopian Government claims that the standards used by the Chinese companies to build the railway did not take flooding into account. CCECC and CREC, however, argue that their standards accounted for potential floods, but that, in the flooded sections, tracks were stolen, causing structural damage to the railroad. Field interview evidence has also revealed a number of accidents involving animals (camels in particular) being hit by trains and killed. As the ERC has paid more than the market price for camels in compensation, there are suspicions that people are pushing their camels in front of trains deliberately. There is a plan is to build a fence along the railway, which should reduce accidents and enable trains to travel faster, from the current 50 km/h to 80 km/h. However, there is a risk that this may in turn create other problems, including interrupting paths used by people and animals. Railway service interruptions have also occurred due to protests, For example, in late July 2021, a group of Somali Region protestors blocked the railway line following an attack by Afar regional militia. The line reopened on August 3, 2021.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Government Agency",248699346.697845,"The 759 km railway begins at Sebeta, just outside of Ethiopia's capital of Addis Ababa.

The loan had achieved a 100.3% disbursement rate ($214,999,389 out of $214,200,000) as of December 31, 2021. The borrower made repayments worth $20,000,000 in 2018, $20,000,000 in 2019, $20,000,000 in 2020 and $20,000,000 in 2021.

By early 2022, it was clear that the loan was non-performing. On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a ‘pre-emptive’ sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. Its decision to suspend external debt service reportedly affected all China Development Bank loans with amounts outstanding at the time of the announcement.  By March 2023, the Government of Sri Lanka had accumulated $338 million in arrears to China Development Bank.  The purpose of the project, which was also known as the ‘Construction of Head Work of Moragahakanda Reservoir Project’ and the ‘Three Gorges Project in Sri Lanka,’ was to provide water for irrigation purposes for those living in northern region of Sri Lanka. Another goal of the project was to supply drinking water to millions of local people. It is also expected to generate 20 megawatts of power, addressing a long-term need for domestic and industrial electricity demand in the north-central, northern and eastern provinces. To achieve these goals, a 61m high and 465m long dam was constructed and reservoir was impounded. Upon completion, it was expected that the Moragahakanda reservoir would hold 570 million cubic metres (MCM) of water covering an extent of 2,950 hectares. The intended beneficiaries of this project are people living in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Mathale, and Trincomalee districts.   Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for project implementation.

On July 5, 2017, the Ethiopian House of Representatives ratified the PBC agreement under Proclamation No.1044/2017. The proclamation went into effect on August 3, 2017. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance approximately 85% of the total cost of a $257,285,160 commercial (EPC) contract between Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCO) and Dongfang Electric Corporation, which was signed on January 15, 2016.  According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $218,692,386 (ETB 3,216,027,397) PBC achieved a 34% disbursement rate as of October 28, 2019, with China Eximbank making 3 loan disbursements (worth $59,759.07180 or ETB 1,727,628,763) between 2018 and 2019: a $12,882,512.77 (ETB 355,185,058) disbursement on June 29, 2018, a $12,244,641.29 (ETB 355,832,746) disbursement on August 9, 2019, and a $34,631,917.74 (ETB 1,016,610,959) disbursement on October 25, 2019.   The purpose of the project is to install 80 wind turbines with a single unit capacity of 1.5 megawatts with a total installed capacity of 120 megawatts. The project also involves the construction of access roads for operation and maintenance (O&M), the construction of one 230kV step-up substation connected to the 230kV national grid, and provision of training to the O&M team. The EPC contract with Dongfang Electric Corporation also specifies a 5-year Defect Liability Period. Once operational, the wind farm is expected to have an annual power output of 467 gigawatt-hours and provide power to the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway and the Dire Dawa Industrial Park. It is also expected to ensure stable and sufficient power for the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Economic Corridor. Additionally, it is envisaged that part of the electricity that Aysha wind farm generates will be exported to Djibouti to generate foreign exchange for Ethiopia.   The project site is located in the Shenelle Zone of the Ethiopian Somali State some 465 km north-east of Addis Ababa. Dongfang Electric Corporation is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation.   The implementation of the project commenced on February 25, 2017 and it was originally expected to reach completion within 18 months (August 25, 2018). However, a formal groundbreaking ceremony did not take place until May 2018 and the project has encountered various delays and implementation problems. First, EEPCO was unable to pay an advance payment to Dongfang Electric Corporation (per the contractual schedule) due to ‘financial constraints’. Second, wind turbine installation has proven challenging due to high and variable wind speeds, which have made it difficult to lift heavy load; the nacelle, tower and generator had to be hoisted into place when the wind speed was less than 10m/s. Third, due to high temperature, most of the concrete pouring of the WTG foundation had to be done at night. Fourth, land compensation and right of way issues led to implementation problems. When Dongfang Electric Corporation started site works after receiving right of way from EEPCO, some people started to build dwelling near the project site and Dongfang Electric Corporation was forced to stop site work. Fifth, there was a delay of cement supply from a local factory due to projects’ priority by government. Sixth, construction was interrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In late March 2020, Dongfang Electric Corporation was delivering equipment — including a wind turbine, a generator and a tower — from Djibouti Port to the project site in Ethiopia. But at that time Ethiopia had just shut down its border to minimize the spread of the coronavirus, which left four Chinese technicians stranded in Ethiopia. Dongfang Electric Corporation then sent technicians from its headquarters in China to enable the work required to transport the equipment. That action reportedly prevented the construction work from grinding to a halt. On July 12, 2021, Dongfang Electric Corporation (DEC) held an online open house event at the Aysha Wind Farm Project.   As of August 2021, the project had reportedly achieved a 75% completion rate and generated more than 300 local jobs. The project's scheduled completion date was eventually pushed back until the end of 2022.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase II of the Aysha Wind Power Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs.

The Government of Sri Lanka on-lent the proceeds of the loan to Airport & Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd (a Sri Lankan state-owned enterprise).  The borrower was expected to use the loan proceeds to finance a commercial contract [No. HIA2009.11] between Airport and Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd and China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd, which was signed on November 27, 2009.

The purpose of the project was to construct an alternative airport, located in Mattala, to the Bandaranaike international Airport.  The project involved the construction of a 4 km runway, a parking apron, a taxiway connecting the runaway and the apron, a terminal building, cargo storage, a fuel arm, and a fire service building.   China Harbour Engineering Company was the contractor responsible for project implementation.  Construction began on November 17, 2009. The construction of the runway, apron and taxiways was completed ahead of schedule in February 2012. On January 24, 2013, Sri Lanka’s Minister of Civil Aviation Piyankara Jayaratne reported to parliament that the airport would be declared open on March 18, 2013. On October 16, 2012, a Hawker Beechcraft B200 King Air of the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority became the first aircraft to land at the new airport. The airport was opened for flight operations, as planned, on March 18, 2013. President Rajapaksa, his ministers, and other dignitaries arrived in a SriLankan Airlines Airbus A340 to attend the inauguration ceremony.   This project was plagued by cost overruns and controversy. It ultimately cost $243.7 million to implement the project. However, the original budget for the project was $209 million. The Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport is also widely considered to be a commercial failure. The construction of the 12,000 square meters terminal building was originally designed to support as many as one million travelers per year, and the government envisioned major international carriers bringing travelers from Beijing, Chennai, Dubai, Riyadh, and Bangkok to Hambantota for sporting events, international conferences, eco-tourism, and nightlife. However, it was eventually dubbed ‘the world’s emptiest international airport.’  Sri Lanka’s aviation minister reported to parliament in 2014 that the airport had only earned $123 in revenue in a single month, and when a visiting journalist asked a senior government official about the airport, he indicated, “when I visited the airport there, I asked the sole immigration officer how many passports she’d stamped that day. She said, ‘One’.” Within only a few years of becoming fully operational, the airport was running an annual financial loss of $18 million. Consequently, the airport failed to generate sufficient revenue to facilitate loan repayment. in January 2015, Maithripala Sirisena was elected President of Sri Lanka and one of his first orders was to allow SriLankan Airlines to cancel all flights to Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport.  The national carrier released a public statement that read: ‘[T]he reality is Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport is not needed and is a distraction in Sri Lankan’s efforts to turn itself around. … SriLankan Airlines continues to be highly unprofitable and having to meet the political requirement of developing and operating a second hub [in Hambantota district] will make it even harder to meet its targets for financial improvement.’   Then, in 2017, responsibility for repayment of the China Eximbank loan that was contracted for the construction of Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport Project was transferred from Airport & Aviation Services (Sri Lanka) Ltd to the General Treasury.   On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a ‘pre-emptive’ sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions.

52765,"China (People's Republic of)","Bangladesh","Asia",2018,NA,"China Eximbank provides RMB 1.547 billion government concessional loan for the Modernization of Telecommunication Network for Digital Connectivity Project (MOTN) (Linked to Project ID#52663)","On August 24, 2016, the Government of Bangladesh awarded a contract to a Chinese consortium comprised of ZTE Corporation and ZTE Holdings to upgrade the fixed network of Bangladeshi state-owned Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Limited (BTCL). At that time, the Chinese Government pledged to finance 90% of the total cost of the project. Then, on September 27, 2016, BTCL signed a commercial contract with ZTE Corporation and ZTE Holding Co., Ltd. for the project.   Approximately one year later, on September 10, 2017, the Chinese Government and the Government of Bangladesh signed a preferential loan framework agreement in which the Chinese Government agreed in principle to issue an RMB 1,547,071,939.09 ($231.5 million) loan for the Modernization of Telecommunication Network for Digital Connectivity Project (MOTN). However, there were delays in the signing of the formal loan agreement because the Government of Bangladesh and BTCL were concerned with the higher-than-expected cost of the contract with ZTE. BTCL negotiated with ZTE and managed to reduce the cost, which enabled the project to proceed. Then, on April 10, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh signed an RMB 1,547,071,939.09 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for MOTN Project. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 2%, a maturity period of 21 years, a grace period of 6 years, and a commitment fee (service charge rate) of 0.2%. In addition to the China Eximbank loan, the Government of Bangladesh was expected to contribute ৳7,561,100,000 BDT of counterpart financing for the MOTN project. According to the Government of Bangladesh’s Economic Relations Division (ERD), the GCL had achieved a disbursement rate of 19.9% (RMB 309,414,000 out of RMB 1,547,071,939.09) as of June 30, 2019, 49.8% (RMB 771,139,000 out of RMB 1,547,071,939.09) as of June 30, 2020 and 66.6% (RMB 1,030,397,000 out of RMB 1,547,071,939.09) as of June 30, 2021. No repayments on the GCL had been made as of June 30, 2020 or June 30, 2021.   The purpose of the project is to upgrade the fixed network of BTCL in order to provide a wider, modernized, and cheap range of IP telephony, high-speed Internet, and converged services including video calling and videoconferencing over BTCL’s PSTN access lines, to compete better against mobile alternatives. The MOTN project involves the replacement of BTCL's public switched telephone network system (PSTN) with a IMS (IP Multimedia Subsystem)-based telephone system using Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON) technology that would cover all of Bangladesh's districts with the requisite transmission and IP networks. Upon completion, the project is expected to fulfill the Government of Bangladesh's ‘Vision-2021’ plan and help secure a Digital Bangladesh, More specifically, the MOTN project is expected to divide Bangladesh's IMS Core Exchanges into three parts: Dhaka, Chittagong, and Khulna, each with a capacity of 1,600,000 subscribers. It is also expected to replace old IP exchanges with IP-based Exchange Access gateways.   The MOTN project also involves the creation of eight rings in several Bangladeshi districts, including Dhaka and Chittagong, that would allow the transmission backbone to be more reliable. It also includes the installation of a pair of core routers in Chittagong, Dhaka, and Khulna. A national operations center with 21 large monitors capable of monitoring the network will be created by the project. A submarine cable connection through Cox's Baxar and Kuawakata, through India via Benapole, is also supposed to be established to improve the network's resiliency.   Additionally, the project will develop a computerized model using BTCL's existing optical fiber and the MOTN upgrades in order to better monitor the optical fiber network status. ZTE Corporation is the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor responsible for implementation and Bangladesh's Ministry of Posts, Telecommunications and Information Technology is responsible for project supervision. The Government Bangladesh's Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) approved the project on October 17, 2017.   The project was expected to take 3 years to implementation. ZTE reportedly began work in January 2019. However, the project's official commencement ceremony was held on January 8, 2020. The project implementation period was originally expected to take place between July 2017 and June 2020. However, a revised Development Project Proposal (DPP) was sent to Bangladesh's Posts and Telecommunications Division for approval by the ECNEC; the DPP proposed the extension of the project implementation period by an additional two years and an increase in the project cost to ৳33,749,400,000 BDT from ৳25,733,900,000 BDT. The new expected completion time was June 30 2022. On September 15, 2020, the project’s Business Operation and Support System (BOSS) and Network Operation Center (NOC) were launched, which signified that the project was entering a new (commercial use) phase. The COVID-19 pandemic led to various project implementation challenges and delays. Additionally due to heavy rains and floods, the project encountered significant problems, including the destruction of fiber and trench damage. A controversy also arose when a Bangladesh newspaper, The New Nation, alleged that ZTE had ‘arm-twisted [the] Ministry of Post and Telecommunication into buying additional switch boards’ for MOTN even though said switch boards were reportedly ‘substandard and useless.’    As of July 2023, the Government of Bangladesh reports the project as 75% complete.","Implementation","Development","Loan","ODA-like","COMMUNICATIONS","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Recipient Government Agency|Recipient State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese Private Sector",254930973.893128,"This project covers the following areas: 1. 3 IMS core at Dhaka, Chattogram and Khulna for 1,600,000 subscribers. 2.

Following the signing of the framework agreement, on September 28, 2007, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola.  The MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility, was designed to finance 100 projects via individual loan agreements (ILAs). The MLFA was split between a $1.0 billion phase I facility and a $1.0 billion phase II facility.  Availability of the phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA was a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank could conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts. ILAs approved through the MLFA carried the following estimated borrowing terms: an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR 3 plus a 1.5% margin, a 13.75 maturity, a 1.25 year grace period, a management fee of 0.3%, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections. The process was managed by an office in the Angolan Ministry of Finance -- known as Gabinete de Apoio Técnico (GAT) -- that was specifically created to manage the MLFA with China Eximbank.

(2) On November 8, 2009, China Eximbank and the Vietnam Ministry of Finance signed a $250 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC No.2009 (24) Total No. (86)] for this railway project (see Project #34616). The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: 4% interest rate, 15-year maturity, and 5-year maturity.   (3) On May 11, 2017, China Eximbank and the Vietnam Ministry of Finance signed an RMB 1.678 million ($250.62 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL No.2017 (24) Total No. (629)] for this railway project (see Project #63214). The loan terms are unknown. This GCL came into effect on December 28, 2017 and the fist disbursement took place on April 28, 2018.  The borrower was to use the proceeds from these loans to partially finance an EPC contract with China Railway Sixth Bureau Group Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of China Railway Group. The purpose of the project is to construct a 13 km light rail — that travels at 80 km per hour — in the capital city of Hanoi that passes through 12 stations: Cat Linh, La Thanh, Thai Ha, Lang, Thuong Dinh, Vanh Dai 3, Phung Khoang, Van Quan, Ha Dong, La Khe, Van Khe, Yen Nghia. The project officially commenced on October 10, 2011 and the new railway line was originally scheduled to launch in June 2015, but the completion date of the project has been postponed at least four times.   The project has encountered multiple problems and delays during implementation. In 2013, the project faced difficulties related to demolition and relocation, including the fact that the terrain was ideal for machinery and the construction site was close to traffic. Then, in 2014, the total cost of the project increased from $552.86 million to $868.04 million, forcing the Government of Vietnam to contract a supplementary loan from China Eximbank (see Project #63214).   In January 2015, the project faced major criticism from the Vietnamese government for multiple accidents during construction. Vietnamese officials and experts have repeatedly raised concerns about the project’s safety, with several accidents killing or injuring workers and passersby. In early 2016, Vietnam’s Ministry of Transport and China Railway Sixth Bureau Group Co., Ltd agreed on a new launch date in December 2016, before correcting themselves that the line would not be launched until early 2017. In February 2017, the railway line’s completion was postponed for another year, with a new launch set for February 2018.   In February 2017, the first set of trains (out of 13 total) was installed on the track . Each train is worth $63.2 million, and manufactured by China's Beijing Subway Rolling Stock Equipment Ltd. In 2018, the project manager submitted a proposal for the railway line to begin a test run in September 2018, setting the date for an official launch to be in 2021. On September 20, 2018, the first stage of a trial run was initiated, which was meant to last 3-6 months. The project is currently slated for completion on April 30, 2021. More than 600 people were reportedly hired to support the implementation of this project.","Implementation","Development","Loan","ODA-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese Private Sector|Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Government Agency|Recipient State-owned Company",263233702.972089,"The purpose of the project is to construct a 13 km light rail — that travels at 80 km per hour — in the capital city of Hanoi that passes through 12 stations: Cat Linh, La Thanh, Thai Ha, Lang, Thuong Dinh, Vanh Dai 3, Phung Khoang, Van Quan, Ha Dong, La Khe, Van Khe, Yen Nghia.

It is the only hydropower plant operating on the Shweli river in Myanmar. Its exact locational coordinates are 23.699, 97.506422.  400 megawatts (67%) of the power plant’s 600 megawatts are reportedly consumed in Myanmar, and 200 megawatts are exported to PRC through a double circuit 220 kV transmission line.   Following the Government of Myanmar's inability to secure funding for the project, Yunnan Joint Power Development Co. (YUPD) was established as a joint venture in August 2006 by Huaneng Langcang River Hydropower Co., Ltd. (50% ownership stake), Yunnan Hexing Investment and Development Co., Ltd. (34% ownership stake), and Yunnan Union Resources & Engineering Co. Ltd. (16%  ownership stake). Then, on May 22, 2007, YUPD and Myanmar Ministry of Electric Power jointly established Shweli I Hydropower Co. (SHPC), with Yunnan United Power Development Co., Ltd. holding 80% of the shares and Myanmar’s Ministry of Electric Power holding 20% of the shares (see Project ID#49904).   With the approval of the Government of Myanmar, the Shweli I Hydropower Plant was developed on a BOT (build-operation-transfer) basis. The BOT agreement was signed on December 30, 2006. In accordance with the Joint Venture Agreement, Myanmar can use 15% of the electricity generated from the power station for free. The validity of the franchise right is 40 years. The total cost of the project was RMB 3.2 billion RMB, of which RMB 2.96 billion was invested by Chinese parties.  Huaneng Langcang River Hydropower Co., Ltd. reportedly received a loan to support its investment in YUPD. It is also known that China Eximbank issued an overseas investment loan (境外投资贷款) for the 600MW Shweli 1 Hydropower Plant Construction Project, which is likely the loan that Huaneng Langcang River Hydropower Co., Ltd. received to support its investment in YUPD.     The Shweli 1 HPP has a 47 meter high concrete gravity dam that diverts water through a headrace tunnel to the powerhouse some 9.5 km downstream. The 10 km long reservoir created by the dam is also small and narrow (about 120 m wide on average) inundating 1.3 km2 and storing 24 hm3. It is equipped with six, 100 MW power generation units. Sinohydro Corporation Limited was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. On December 10, 2006, the project realized river closure. Then, on September  5, 2008, the first power generation unit was put into operation. In April 2009, the last power generation unit was put into operation.

85359,"China (People's Republic of)","Indonesia","Asia",2007,2009,"Bank of China contributes to a $884 million USD syndicated loan for Tangguh Liquefied Natural Gas Project (Linked to Project ID#97811)","On October 29, 2007, a syndicate of banks (including Bank of China, BTMU, DNB, Intesa San Paulo, Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., and Royal Bank of Scotland) signed an $884 million loan agreement with a trustee [HSBC USA (New York)] and Japan International Finance Management (Tangguh) Corporation — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) — for the Tangguh Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project. The loan carried a maturity of 13.6 years and an interest rate of LIBOR (October 2007 6M LIBOR: 5.051%) plus a 0.335% margin. China National Offshore Oil Corporation  (CNOOC) — a Chinese state-owned enterprise — issued a corporate guarantee in support of the loan. Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., served as the facility agent for the loan.   The $884 million loan, known as the ‘Fujian tranche,’ is ring-fenced from the rest of the project and the revenues to service it will be drawn from the 25-year contract to supply 2.6 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG to CNOOC, initially through the latter’s Fujian LNG-receiving terminal. Under the trustee borrowing structure, loans are repaid from an agreed portion of gross proceeds under identified offtake contracts. The buyers make payments directly to the trustee and paying agent [HSBC USA (New York)]. The trustee is also the borrower under the loan agreement with the lenders, and the debt service payments are made from the trustee accounts. Except as otherwise provided, the lenders look to this source of debt service for all loans, with no recourse to the project and no security interest in the project assets or contracts.   Prior to the issuance of this loan, several other loans were issued for the same project: a $1.2 billion loan from Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), a $350 million loan from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), a $1.066 billion syndicated loan from a group of commercial banks, and an August 2006 $1.3 billion USD syndicated term loan from a syndicate of five Chinese state-owned banks — Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), China Construction Bank Corporation (CCB), China Development Bank (CB), the Export-Import Bank of China, and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) — as captured via Project ID#97811.  The debt financing package involves a complex multi-tranche Indonesian trustee borrowing structure. Repayment of the loans is supported by revenues from long-term LNG sale and purchase agreements with K-Power in South Korea, POSCO in South Korea and Sempra Energy via a receiving terminal in Mexico.   The purpose of the project is to construct an integrated greenfield liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility — with two LNG process trains (Train 1 and 2) — on the south side of Bintuni Bay in Teluk Bintuni Regency within Papua Barat Province. The LNG plant is comprised of two main components: (i) the offshore gas production facilities including 14 producing wells, 2 platforms (“trains”), and subsea pipelines to feed gas to the onshore facilities; and (ii) the onshore LNG production facilities and associated facilities, which include two identical production trains (Train 1 and 2), storage tanks for LNG (2 x 170,000 m3 ) and condensate (1 x 120,000 barrel), marine berthing facilities, utilities, offices and living facilities, off-site camp, airfield and jetty. Design optimizations together with deferral of the airfield and associated access road almost halved the site footprint. Upon completion, it was envisaged that the project would have 7.6 million tons per annum (mtpa) of production capacity to the existing Tangguh LNG facility.   The Tangguh Liquefied Natural Gas Project took shape in the mid-1990s upon the discovery of substantial gas reserves in the area. Proven reserves are around 14.4 trillion cubic feet (TCF). The project was initiated in 1997 by Atlantic Richfield Company (a US oil company) and Pertamina (a state-owned oil and gas enterprise). In April 1999, BP Plc (BP) acquired Atlantic Richfield Company and took over its lead role. Its 7 gas fields, under production-sharing contracts (PSCs), are developed under a partnership between consortia of international contractors (the PSC Contractors) and BPMIGAS as the governmental counterparty. The PSC Contractors, led by BP Berau as the Operator, operate jointly in upstream development and LNG processing for export to international markets. In May 2003, BP approached multilateral and bilateral financial institutions to seek financial assistance together with a commitment to assist the project in implementing best practices following international environmental and social guidelines.    The project began construction following the resettlement in July 2004 of Tanah Merah village (the LNG plant site). Engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contracts were entered into with a consortium of Kellogg Overseas Corporation, JGC, and PT Pertafenikki (KJP; for onshore facilities) and with PT Saipem Indonesia (for offshore facilities) in March 2005, followed by immediate issuance of the notice to proceed to start the construction. As of March 2007, the project had achieved a 70% completion rate. The offshore facilities were handed over to the project owner by May 2007. The onshore facilities were ready for start-up in January 2009 (Train 1) and June (Train 2) 2009. The first LNG production (first drop) occurred in Train 1 in June 2009. The first LNG shipment was made on July 6, 2009 using the Tangguh Foja LNG carrier.  Following the project’s achievement of ready for start-up status in 2009, the start-up process continued until mid-2011 to address technical issues, perform modification works, and ensure the stable operation and higher production efficiency of the LNG plant. Over a 3-year period from first drop in June 2009 up to June 2012 the project had produced a total of 37.8 million m3 of LNG and 5.1 million barrels of condensate.   Bank of China also contributed to a syndicated loan in 2016 that financed the third train of the Tangguh Liquefied Natural Gas Project (captured in Project ID#73318).","Completion","Commercial","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Commercial Bank","Other Private Sector|Recipient Private Sector|Recipient Private Sector",265091619.072259,"The purpose of the project is to construct an integrated greenfield liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility — with two LNG process trains (Train 1 and 2) — on the south side of Bintuni Bay in Teluk Bintuni Regency within Papua Barat Province.

Then, on April 3, 2014, the Ethiopian House of Representatives ratified the GCL agreement under Proclamation No. 833/2014, and the agreement entered into force on May 14, 2014. The loan (captured via Project ID#30915) carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, and a 0.25% commitment fee. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the GCL to finance a $225 million commercial (EPC) contract between Ethiopian Airports Enterprise (EAE) — the state-owned entity tasked with administering Ethiopia's airports — and China Communications Construction Company Ltd (CCCC), which was signed in 2012.   Then, on December 27, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Ethiopia signed a $117,300,000 (ETB 2,623,784,348) preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport Terminal 1, VIP Terminal, Associated Works Design and Build Project. The Ethiopian House of Representatives ratified the PBC (loan) agreement, which is captured via Project ID#58583, on February 7, 2017. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds from the PBC to finance 85% of the cost of a $138 million commercial contract between Ethiopian Airports Enterprise (EAE) — the state-owned entity tasked with administering Ethiopia's airports — and China Communications Construction Company Ltd (CCCC).

According to the Government of Ethiopia’s AMP, the $117,300,000 (ETB 2,623,784,348) loan achieved a 37% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making a single disbursement of ETB 962,974,366 on December 22, 2017.   The shared purpose of these two projects — the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport Expansion Project and the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport Terminal 1, VIP Terminal, Associated Works Design and Build Project — was to increase the annual passenger handling capacity of Addis Ababa Bole International Airport from the 7 million to 22 million. These two projects involved the expansion of an existing terminal (Terminal 1) with a floor area of 30,000 square meters for domestic and regional trips, the construction of a new terminal (Terminal 2) with a floor area of 74,000 square meters for international trips, and the construction of a VIP terminal. Upon completion, Terminal 2 was expected to have three floors—arrival, departure and ground floors — and include boarding areas, lounges, recreation centers, shopping malls, offices, parking, and other facilities. The VIP terminal — designed for use by leaders, senior government officials, diplomats and other dignitaries — was expected to includes various saloons, lounges, conference rooms, recreation centers, duty-free shops, an IT center and an exclusive parking lot.   Addis Ababa Bole International Airport is located in the Bole area of the city of Addis Ababa, 6 km (3.7 mi) southeast of the city center and 65 km (40 mi) north of Debre Zeyit. Its coordinates are 08°58′40″N 38°47′58″E.  CCCC was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by EAE. The French construction firm ADP Ingénierie supervised construction activities, while the design of the project was managed by CPG Corporation Pte. Ltd., a Singaporean company. Shanxi Construction investment Group Co. Ltd was also involved in the project (most likely as a subcontractor).   The purpose of the $225 million EPC contract between CCCC and EAE was to construct Terminal 2 (‘Phase 1’). The purpose of the $138 million EPC contract between CCCC and EAE was to construct the VIP terminal and expand Terminal 1 (‘Phase 2’).  Phase 1 construction activities began in June 2014. By December 11, 2016, Phase 1 had achieved a 40% completion rate. Phase 1 was originally expected to reach completion by January 2018 (in time for the 30th Ordinary Summit of the African Union). However, it was ultimately completed and officially inaugurated on January 27, 2019. The inauguration ceremony was attended by Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. Phase 2 implementation activities commenced in September 2017 and were still underway four years later. On March 30, 2021, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed visited the new VIP terminal being built at the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport. Phase 2 was originally scheduled for completion on May 15, 2021. However, as of April 2022, AidData had not yet found any evidence of project completion.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Addis Ababa Bole International Airport Expansion Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs.

Dexia Group served as the senior lead arranger, and KfW and HSH-Nordbank served as arrangers, and also contributed about $57.86 million each. BBVA, SanPaolo IMI, Shinhan, and Itau BBA were all co-arrangers, and contributed $50 million, $50 million, $40 million, and $30 million respectively. Caterpillar and Nordkap were participants, contributing $15 million and $10 million respectively. The International Finance Corporation (IFC) contributed a $50 million loan as a participant as well. Some sources indicate multiple Chinese banks were involved in the syndicate, one source specifying the China Construction Bank.  The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance the construction of two semi submersible drilling platforms known as Schahin I and Schahin III. Petrobras was expected to use the drilling platforms in the Campos Basin offshore Brazil. The rigs (drilling platforms) were to be built by Singapore’s Yantai Raffles Shipyard Company, with whom two EPC contracts were signed, at its facilities in China. EPC contract terms included performance guarantees issued by Sinosure for 10% of the contract values, liquidated damages equal to 5% of the contract values, and, according to some sources, retention payments equivalent to 15% of the contract values.  Schahin I was to be operated under a seven-year contract with Petrobras starting in 2010 and was designed to operate at depths up to 2,000m, with a drilling depth of 7,500 meters below the seabed. The contract was won in a Brazilian-only bid. The Schahin III rig received a five year contract after a bidding process open to international firms. It was designed to operate at a depth of 2,400 meters, respectively, also with a drilling depth of 7,500 meters below the seabed. Construction for both rigs was expected to take 3.5 years.  However, on December 18, 2009, Black Gold Drilling refinanced the $800 million due to delays in project implementation. The new loan had borrowing terms of LIBOR plus a 3.38% margin and a tenor of 11 years. The portion of the refinanced loan contributed by CDB is captured in project ID#59968. As with the original loan, several sources indicate additional Chinese banks participated, such as China Construction Bank or Bank of China.  While the exact start and end dates of the rigs' construction are unknown, the project was completed, and the rights to the two drilling platforms were sold to ICBC in 2014 through a sale-leaseback transaction in order to repay the loan.  Then, on July 13, 2021, a lawsuit was filed against a total of twelve banks (involved in one or both of the syndicates) by several subsidiaries of the Schahin Group. The lawsuit claimed that the banks had collaborated 'with the CEO and CFO of two Schahin Group entities [to sell] the oil rigs to ICBC below fair value when the Schahin Group was in financial distress.'","Completion","Development","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Other State-owned Company",269889657.432615,"This project contributes to a syndicated loan to Black Gold Drilling, which is a subsidiary of Schahin Engenharia.

58012,"China (People's Republic of)","South Sudan","Africa",2018,NA,"China Eximbank provides $248.8 million loan for Air Traffic Management System (ATMS) Project","On January 25, 2018, the Chinese Ambassador to South Sudan and the South Sudanese Finance Minister signed a preferential loan framework agreement. On the same day, the Government of South Sudan and China Eximbank signed a $248.8 million loan agreement for the Air Traffic Management System (ATMS) Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known the borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance a commercial (EPC) contract between South Sudan Civil Aviation Authority and China Harbor Engineering Company (CHEC) Limited, which was signed on October 14, 2016. This loan is reportedly secured by (collateralized against) airport fees/revenues that the borrower is required to deposit in a lender-controlled escrow account.  The loan's amount outstanding was $231,952,567 as of December 2022.  The purpose of the project is to construct Juba ATMS center, a new Air Traffic control tower and operation building, a surveillance system, a navigation system, and a communication system. The Juba ATMS center is located next to Juba International Airport. The project also involves the civil engineering and supporting facilities required by the equipment (such as meteorological facilities), calibration flight test training, and other forms of training for South Sudanese technicians (to prepare them for management of the air space by 2023).   CHEC is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Project implementation commenced in June 2020 and it was originally expected to reach completion by June 2023. On July 6, 2021, South Sudan Civil Aviation Authority (SSCAA) announced the launch of a state-of-the-art online system, which allows the opening of new routes. The newly established lower airspace, launched in partnership with aviation solutions provider NavPass, is designed to boost tourism and generate revenue for the economy, according to SSCAA. Through the system, operators of commercial, cargo, and aid aircraft can integrate Juba International Airport into their routes. ""Through this partnership with NavPass, South Sudan will see higher volumes of aviation trade, greater business opportunities, and improved route efficiency, safety, and reliability,"" explained Capt. David Subek Dada, SSCAA's Chief Executive Officer (CEO). He added, ""This marks a crucial step towards a more prosperous future for the whole of South Sudan through additional direct and indirect economic activity.” Speaking during the launch of the air traffic management system, Tom Perkins, the CEO of NavPass said the establishment of internationally compliant and globally accessible airspace was a critical and symbolic move for the country in building economic potential, connectivity, and business. ""For every dollar invested in sovereign airspace, capacity translates into between five and 20 dollars of economic impact. We're proud to be working with governments across the world, including South Sudan, to optimize and monetize airspace, bridging the divide between nations,"" he noted. Built on the global-standard Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) system, South Sudan's airspace reportedly uses an AI-powered platform to record all flights in real-time. The system automatically collects more than 99% of eligible fees, compared with the 70-80% collected by some of the world's largest economies. NavPass chief executive, Thomas Perkins, said that apart from capturing the movement of all aircraft in the country’s skies in real-time, the technology will also automate the fee collection process with proceeds invested back into the country’s air infrastructure, in line with the United Nations’ International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) principles. The revenues that are collected will reportedly be transferred into an escrow account.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Air Traffic Management System (ATMS) Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In March 2023, the World Bank and the IMF judged the Government of South Sudan to be at a high risk of debt distress. Then, on June 14, 2023, South Sudan’s National Transport Minister Madut Biar on Wednesday revealed that CHEC had halted work its work on the ATMS Project due to delays in the payment of an outstanding bill worth $36 million. He said that the Government of South Sudan had a contractual obligation to pay CHEC $6.2 million every January 21 and July 21, but this did not happen because of a failure to pay by South Sudan's Ministry of Finance.  Two weeks later, on June 27, 2023, the Chinese Government called upon the Government of South Sudan to expedite the payment of arrears for the construction of the country’s ATMS. Speaking to Radio Tamazuj during an interview, Mu Jianjun, the Economic and Commercial Counsellor in the Chinese Embassy in South Sudan, said that China Eximbank had halted the project and was waiting for the Government of South Sudan to pay the arrears for the works done before completing the construction of the country's ATMS. Mu Jianjun said “[w]e are waiting for payment from the Government of South Sudan and we suggested that the government pays as soon as possible because this project is very important for South Sudan.""","Implementation","Development","Loan","ODA-like","OTHER SOCIAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND SERVICES","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company",271154617.272214,"The project revamps South Sudan's Air Traffic Management System through technical assistance, the construction of an ATMS center in Juba, a new Air Traffic control tower and operation building, surveillance system, navigation system, communication system, and the civil engineering and supporting facilities required by the equipment such as meteorological facilities, calibration flight test, and personnel training (see: 'Chinese-built Air Traffic Management System project near completion in South Sudan').

The IFC contributed $195 million and four additional banks (the Bank of China, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Standard Bank, and the Dutch development bank FMO) contributed $231 million. Four different branches of Bank of China (the Shanghai Branch, the Luxembourg branch, the Paris branch, and the Stockholm branch) collectively contributed $231 million to the loan syndicate and ICBC reportedly contributed $144.3 million to the loan syndicate. Project ID#59302 captures the contribution from Bank of China and #73212 captures the contribution from ICBC.

Then, on June 11, 2012, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed two additional loan agreements: a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All five loan agreements (collectively worth $2.7 billion) were financed by Samruk-Kazyna via borrowings from the $3 billion CDB line of credit.  All of the loans carried the following borrowing terms: maturities of between 12 and 15 years (with final maturity dates falling between January 2022 and August 2025), 3 year grace periods (with the first loan repayment scheduled for January 2013), annual interest rates of LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin, and 1.5% management fees. A separate fee of $3 million was also payable under the loan agreements for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Project and the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All of the loans were also backed by repayment guarantees from KAZ Minerals PLC and a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna. All five loans reportedly disbursed in full by January 2013. The remaining $300 million under the $3 billion CDB line of credit was utilized (drawn down) by Samruk-Kazyna for an unknown purposes and fully repaid in January 2013. In January 2014, KAZ Minerals PLC fully repaid its loans for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project (since the development of these projects was no longer expected to commence in the near future). Then, on December 29, 2014, two of the loan agreements that KAZ Minerals Finance PLC had previously signed with Samruk-Kazyna (via on-lending from the CDB line of credit) were transformed into bilateral loan agreements with CDB: the loan agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project and the loan agreement for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project. At that time, the face value of the loan for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project was $1,844,000,000 (most likely because some repayments were made between January 2013 and December 2014) and the face value of the loan for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project was upsized to $148,500,000 (for an unknown reason). At that time the borrowing, terms of the two loans with outstanding balances were rescheduled.  The interest rate was lowered from LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin to LIBOR plus a 4.50% margin; and an arrangement fee of 0.5% was agreed upon, of which 60% was paid in December 2014 and 40% was paid in January 2016. The maturities and grace periods of the loan were left unchanged. KAZ Minerals PLC continued to serve as a guarantor for the loans. However, as an additional credit enhancement, the borrower pledged a $100,000,000 minimum cash balance in a charge account (collection account) as a source of collateral. The amended, bilateral loan (facility) agreements between CDB and KAZ Minerals also clarified that the loan proceeds were to be used by the borrower ‘principally for the development of the Bozshakol and Bozymchak [mine] projects.’ As of December 31, 2020, $1.0 billion was drawn down by the borrower under the $1,844,000,000 CDB loan agreement and the $148,500,000 CDB loan agreement. During 2020, the borrower made a $183 million repayment. An additional $181 million repayment was due in 2021. Both CDB loans are repayable in semi-annual installments each January and July with final maturity dates in August 2025.

72500,"China (People's Republic of)","Jordan","Middle East",2017,NA,"China Construction Bank contributes $244 million to syndicated buyer’s credit loan for 554MW Attarat Oil Shale Fired Power Plant Project (Linked to Project ID#64457, ID#72499, ID#72502, and ID#52552)","In October 2014, Jordan’s National Electric Power Company (NEPCO) signed a 30-year power purchase agreement with a consortium led by Eesti Energia (Enefit) — an Estonian utility company that operates most of the world’s installed oil shale generation capacity — to build an oil shale-fired power plant in Attarat (Attarat um Ghudran), a town located 100 km southeast of Amman. The exact locational coordinates of the power plant are 31°16′08″N 36°26′52″E. It was envisaged that the plant would utilize Jordan’s vast reserves of oil shale and help reduce the country’s reliance upon imports of oil products for power generation. Upon completion, this plant was expected to consume around 10 million tons of oil shale per year and generate 470 megawatts of baseload power by 2021. The plant would reportedly generate enough power to meet 10-15% of Jordan's electricity needs (about 3.7 billion kWh). NEPCO would act as the plant’s sole offtaker. The total cost of this project was $2.11 billion and it was implemented as an independent power project (IPP) and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25.   On March 16, 2017, a consortium of four Chinese state-owned banks signed a $1.582 billion syndicated loan agreement with Attarat Power Company (APCO) — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and project company that is owned by YTL Power International Bhd of Malaysia (45% ownership stake), Guangdong Yudean Group Co. Ltd of China (45% ownership stake), and Eesti Energia AS (Enefit) of Estonia (10% ownerships stake) — for the 554MW Attarat Oil Shale Fired Power Plant Project. The syndicated buyer’s credit loan reportedly consisted of a $594 million contribution from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (captured in Project ID#52552), a $594 million contribution from Bank of China (captured in Project ID#72499), a $244 million contribution from China Construction Bank (captured in Project ID#72500), and a $150 million contribution from China Eximbank (captured in Project ID#72502). The borrowing terms were as follows: a 15 year maturity and an annual interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (1.426% in March 2017) plus a 3% margin. Sinosure provided buyer’s credit insurance to the the borrower. An extensive security package was also provided to the lenders that covers all of the infrastructure and materials required to operate the plant, including over the valuable land concession from the Government of Jordan.   The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract that APCO signed with Guangdong Power Engineering Corporation (GPEC) — a subsidiary of China Energy Engineering Corporation — on October 31, 2014. Under the terms of this EPC contract, GPEC agreed to undertake, on a turnkey basis, the design, engineering, procurement, construction, erection, interconnection, commissioning, start-up, testing, completion, placing in operation and delivery of the oil shale fired electric generation plant. Foster Wheeler was responsible for the provision of the circulating fluidized bed boilers. Siemens was responsible for the provision of steam turbine generators. Worley Parsons was responsible or the design of the power plant. In addition to the debt financing that was used to support this project, the shareholders in APCO agreed to provide ‘base shareholder funding’ (i.e. equity investments) of up to $528 million. These equity contributions were announced on March 16, 2017 after Enefit of Estonia and Near East Investment sold a 15% equity stake in APCO to YTL Power International Bhd and a 45% equity stake in APCO to Guangdong Yudean Group Co. Ltd (see Project ID#64457). Guangdong Yudean Group Co. Ltd is a Chinese state-owned utility that is jointly owned by Guangdong Province (76% equity stake) and China Huaneng Group (24% equity stake).   As of 2017, the 554MW Attarat Oil Shale Fired Power Plant Project was the largest private sector investment and example of limited recourse financing in Jordan’s history. Upon completion, it was expected to have 554MW of gross power generation capacity and 477MW of net power generation capacity. It was expected to consist of two circulating-fluidized-bed units and draw oil shale from a nearby open cast mine. It was expected to employ 5,500 individuals (including 2,000 Chinese nationals) during the construction phase and 1,000 individuals each year after the construction phase is completed. On March 16, 2017, APCO issued a ‘notice to proceed’ to the EPC contractor (GPEC). Then, on March 20, 2017, construction began. Project implementation was suspended for two months during the spring of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, construction resumed in May 2020.   The project is ultimately expected to deliver power generation capacity in two phases: 235MW in 2020 and 235MW in 2021. APCO has entered into a 30-year agreement with NEPCO for the sale of the plant’s entire power generation capacity following its construction. The 2 x 235 MW Attarat oil shale-fired power plant project is expected to deliver capacity in two phases, 235 MW in 2H 2020 and 235 MW in 1H 2021. Unit 1 of the 2 x 235 MW Attarat oil shale-fired power plant, which also includes an open-cast mine, was synchronized with Jordan’s national grid on May 26, 2021. As of the same date, the entire project had achieved a 96% completion rate. However, the 554MW Attarat Oil Shale Fired Power Plant Project has become a source of local controversy. To facilitate repayment of the loan (and provide a financial return to its equity holder), APCO entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with National Electric Power Corporation (NEPCO), the Jordanian state-owned power utility. NEPCO agreed to serve as the sole offtaker (i.e., single buyer) and purchase all power generated by the oil shale-fired power plant in Attarat at a price of approximately $0.17 per kilowatt hour (kWh). However, NEPCO signed several other PPAs with private companies around the same time, which resulted in too much power generation capacity and not enough customers.   As of late 2021, many of APCO’s competitors were selling electricity at $0.10 per kilowatt hour (kWh), which put NEPCO between a rock and a hard place: it is contractually obligated to purchase power from APCOM at $0.17 per kWh without enough customers to whom it can resell the power.  On December 19, 2020, NEPCO and the Government of Jordan (GOJ) initiated international arbitration proceedings against APCO with respect to the PPA and the GOJ guarantee of NEPCO’s payment obligations. NEPCO and the GOJ sought declaratory judgments that (a) the $0.17 per kWh tariff is ‘grossly unfair’ and (b) NEPCO can terminate the PPA if its ‘gross unfairness’ is not addressed. APCO has insisted that its loan agreement with ICBC, China Eximbank, Bank of China, and China Construction Bank was based on an internal rate of return (IRR) calculation of 17% (which in turn is based on the $0.17 per kWh tariff) and that it won’t be able to repay its debts if the IRR and tariff rate are downwardly revised.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Commercial Bank","Other Private Sector|Other Private Sector|Chinese State-owned Company|Other Private Sector",281170510.313117,"This project involves the construction of an oil shale-fired power plant in Attarat (Attarat um Ghudran), a town located 100 km southeast of Amman.

Ltd signed a $252 million loan agreement for the 100 MW Jhimpir Wind Farm Project. UEP Wind Power Pvt. Ltd (UEP Wind) is a project company (special purpose vehicle) and a joint venture of Orient Group Investment Holdings Co. Ltd (99% ownership stake) and United Energy Group (1% ownership stake). The 99 MW Jhimpir Wind Project was implemented as an independent power project (IPP) basis. It was reportedly financed with a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25. Based on UEP Wind’s tariff application to Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), the estimated terms of the CDB loan are as follows: 10 year maturity, 2 year grace period, and 5.45% interest rate.   The construction of the United Energy Pakistan (UEP) wind farm involved the installation of 66 wind turbine generators (WTGs), each of which generates 1.5 MW of electricity. The project also involved the construction of a 132KV substation and a control center. China Gezhouba Group Company Limited was the Engineering, Procurement, Construction (EPC) contractor for the project. Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co., Ltd, the largest manufacturer of wind turbines in China, supplied the WTGs. The project site is located at Jhimpir in Thatta district and Sindh province. The 3200 acres of land was provided to the project company (UEP Wind) by the Government of Sindh. The groundbreaking ceremony for the project took place on April 20, 2015. It achieved its commercial operation date (COD) on June 15, 2017.   The electricity from the UEP Wind Farm is supplied to the Hyderabad Electrical Supply Company grid station in Jhimpir. The per unit rate is fixed at USD 0.1352 and thus higher than the rate from the Dawood Wind Power Project, the first China-backed wind farm in Pakistan (USD 0.1187/kWh) but lower than the rate of the Sachal Wind Farm (USD 0.1486/kWh). The 99 MW Jhimpir Wind Project reportedly hired 850 local Pakistani staff and the EPC contractor paid RS. 152,598,971.00 tax to the Pakistan government, while also undertaking a series of corporate social responsibility (CSR) projects in the community, including the construction of a well for the local village as well as the donation of books to local schools.   However, this project has encountered a number of debt repayment and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. In May 2022, reports emerged that the Government of Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to UEP Wind. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 4.3 billion (approximately $21.5 million). Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this “[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country’s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Joint Venture/Special Purpose Vehicle",282813443.533896,"The UEP wind farm is located at Jhimpir in Thatta district and Sindh province.

The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: 20-year maturity, 7-year grace period, 2% interest rate. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $255 million EPC contract with Shanghai Construction Group (SCG).  The Thnal Kaeng-Ang Kroeung Segment of the National Road No. 6 (NR 6) Reconstruction Project was part of a larger initiative that was implemented in three phases (through three separate projects). It was referred to as “Phase 3” of the larger initiative. It involved the expansion of a 248.525 km of NR 6 between Thnal Kaeng (Thnol Kaing) and Ang Kroeung. More specifically, it involved an expansion of three segments of NR 6: a 28.725 km segment between Thnal Kaeng District and Skun District in Kampong Thom Province; a 102.9 segment between Skun District to Stueng Saen District in Kampong Thom Province; and 116.9 km segment between Stueng Saen District and Ang Kroeung District in Siem Reap Province.  The ultimate objective of Phase 3 was to increase connectivity between the capital city of Phnom Penh and the ancient capital city of Siem Reap and other northwest regions.  SCG was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. The project was supervised by Guangzhou Wanan Construction Supervision Company.  Construction officially started on March 5, 2013.

This subsequently produced three different loan agreements:  (1) On October 22, 2008, China Eximbank and the Vietnam Ministry of Finance signed an RMB 1.2 billion ($169 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL No.(14) Total No.(223)] for this railway project (see Project #73326). The borrowing terms of the GCL were as follows: 3% interest rate, 15-year maturity, and 5-year maturity.  (2) On November 8, 2009, China Eximbank and the Vietnam Ministry of Finance signed a $250 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC No.2009 (24) Total No. (86)] for this railway project (see Project #34616). The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: 4% interest rate, 15-year maturity, and 5-year maturity.  (3) On May 11, 2017, China Eximbank and the Vietnam Ministry of Finance signed an RMB 1.678 million ($250.62 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL No.2017 (24) Total No. (629)] for this railway project (Project #63214). The loan terms are unknown. This GCL came into effect on December 28, 2017 and the fist disbursement took place on April 28, 2018.   The borrower was to use the proceeds from these loans to partially finance an EPC contract with China Railway Sixth Bureau Group Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of China Railway Group. The purpose of the project is to construct a 13 km light rail — that travels at 80 km per hour — in the capital city of Hanoi that passes through 12 stations: Cat Linh, La Thanh, Thai Ha, Lang, Thuong Dinh, Vanh Dai 3, Phung Khoang, Van Quan, Ha Dong, La Khe, Van Khe, Yen Nghia. The project officially commenced on October 10, 2011 and the new railway line was originally scheduled to launch in June 2015, but the completion date of the project has been postponed at least four times.  The project has encountered multiple problems and delays during implementation. In 2013, the project faced difficulties related to demolition and relocation, including the fact that the terrain was ideal for machinery and the construction site was close to traffic. Then, in 2014, the total cost of the project increased from $552.86 million to $868.04 million, forcing the Government of Vietnam to contract a supplementary loan from China Eximbank (see Project #63214).  In January 2015, the project faced major criticism from the Vietnamese government for multiple accidents during construction. Vietnamese officials and experts have repeatedly raised concerns about the project’s safety, with several accidents killing or injuring workers and passersby. In early 2016, Vietnam’s Ministry of Transport and China Railway Sixth Bureau Group Co., Ltd agreed on a new launch date in December 2016, before correcting themselves that the line would not be launched until early 2017. In February 2017, the railway line’s completion was postponed for another year, with a new launch set for February 2018.  In February 2017, the first set of trains (out of 13 total) was installed on the track . Each train is worth $63.2 million, and manufactured by China's Beijing Subway Rolling Stock Equipment Ltd. In 2018, the project manager submitted a proposal for the railway line to begin a test run in September 2018, setting the date for an official launch to be in 2021. On September 20, 2018, the first stage of a trial run was initiated, which was meant to last 3-6 months. The project is currently slated for completion on April 30, 2021. More than 600 people were reportedly hired to support the implementation of this project.

The PBC (captured via Project ID#59752) was scheduled for semi-annual repayment every January 21 and July 21. It had a grace period of 84 months from the first loan disbursement date (June 20, 2013) and it was scheduled to be repaid in full 156 months from the end of the grace period. The BCL (captured via Project ID#59733) was scheduled for semi-annual repayment every January 21 and July 21. It had a grace period of 22 months from the first loan disbursement date (July 24, 2013) and it was scheduled to be repaid in full 132 months from the end of the grace period.  The PBC and BCL proceeds were on-lent from Tanzania’s Ministry of Finance to the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC), which in turn used the proceeds to finance a September 2011 commercial (EPC) contract with China Petroleum Technology and Development Corporation (CPTDC), a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Company (CNPC).  The PBC and BCL were both secured with (i.e. collateralized against) all rights under a natural gas sales agreement between the Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO) and TPDC. The borrower (Tanzania’s Ministry of Finance) and end-user (TPDC) was required to deposit profits from the gas pipeline into three Stanbic Bank escrow accounts that were accessible to the lender. According to TPDC’s audited financial statements, the escrow accounts ‘were opened to secure repayment of principal and payment of interest and fees under the loan agreements’ and the minimum cash balances in these accounts functioned as sources of ‘collateral’.

The gas pipeline project was designed and constructed to deliver natural gas to Dar es Salaam for use in power generation, industrial applications, household cooking and in propulsion of transport vehicles. It involved the construction of a 542 kilometer marine and terrestrial pipeline between Songo Songo and Dar Es Salaam as well as two processing plants: one in Songo Songo and another in Mnazi Bay.   The 542-kilometer gas pipeline has four parts: (i) 290-kilometer terrestrial pipeline of 36-inches diameter from Madimba in Mtwara to Somanga Fungu; (ii) 25-kilometer marine pipeline of 24-inches from Songo Songo Island to Somanga Fungu; (iii) 197-kilometer terrestrial pipeline of 36-inches diameter from Somanga Fungu to Kinyerezi in Dar es Salaam; and (iv) 30-kilometer terrestrial pipeline of 16-inches diameter from Kinyerezi to Tegeta in Dar es Salaam. It passes through 1 marine park, 4 regions, 8 districts, 41 wards and 113 villages. The capacity of the main (36 inch) pipeline is rated at 784 million standard cubic feet per day, according to the Natural Gas Utilization Master Plan 2016-2045, but can handle up to 1002 million standard cubic feet per day with compression. It is the longest gas pipeline that has ever been constructed in Tanzania.  CPTDC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction was officially launched on November 8, 2012 and the Tanzanian President inaugurated the constructed pipeline on October 10, 2015. The pipeline was originally scheduled for a completion date in 2014.   Loan repayment was originally expected to depend on gas sales upon completion of the pipeline construction and after the project's commercial operation date (COD). However, a review of the on-lending agreements, Gas Sales Agreements (GSA), and pipeline construction contract revealed that the pipeline was constructed before pre-identification and pre-signing of gas sales agreements between Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) and its expected major gas customers. This anomaly had an effect on loan repayment as actual gas sales came in far below the initial projection of 138.8 million standard cubic feet per day. In fact, according to a report published by the Government of Tanzania's Controller and Auditor General (CAG), TANESCO was the only gas consumer as of March 2017 -- with a consumption average of 46.61 million standard cubic feet per day instead of the agreed amount of at least 80 million standard cubic feet per day as per the GSA between TPDC and TANESCO.  There are also indications that the China Eximbank loans that were issued for the Songo Songo to Dar Es Salaam Gas Pipeline and Natural Gas Processing Plants at Mnazi Bay and Songo Songo Project have financially underperformed vis-a-vis its original objectives and the original expectations of the lender. Tanzania's National Audit Office (NAO) warned of 'Financial Distress Facing TPDC Due to Non-Settlement of TANESCO Long Outstanding Bills TZS 248 Billion' in its Annual General Report on the Audit of Public Authorities and other Bodies for the financial year 2016/2017. More specifically, the NAO noted that 'TPDC and TANESCO entered into a Gas Sales Agreement (GSA) in September 2015 whereby the TANESCO buys natural gas from TPDC for power generation at Kinyerezi, Ubungo II and Symbion Power Plants. I have noted that between September 2015 and December 2017 monthly invoices totaling to TZS 567,514,961,312.95. (USD 254,448,796.08), were issued by TPDC to TANESCO with respects to the natural gas supplied to TANESCO for power generation. My audit noted that by December 2017, TANESCO had managed to settle TZS 318,904,743,618.61 (USD 142,982,887.87) equivalent to 56% of the total amount of invoices leaving TZS 248,610,217,694.34 (USD 111,465,908.21) unsettled. TPDC may not be able to service the loan obtained to facilitate construction of Mtwara-Dar Gas Pipeline from EXIM Bank of China and their respective interests, if TANESCO does not settle this liability. Failure to repay the loan shall subject the Corporation to a compounded interest of 0.8% charged on the unpaid loan balance which will increase financial cost to TPDC and the Government. Further, failure to pay the loan shall amount to transfer of TPDC rights under the Gas Sales Agreement (GSA) to EXIM Bank of China as per Clause 2 of the Security Assignment Contractual Rights which forms of the Agreement signed between TPDC and EXIM Bank of China. The Government through Ministry of Finance and Planning and Ministry of Energy should consider assisting TANESCO in their efforts to settle such long outstanding dues which in turn will help TPDC meet gas purchase and other operational costs.' TPDC’s audited financial statements also indicate that, as the ultimate borrower/end user, it had fallen into arrears by 2017/2018. TPDC’s audited financial statements for the year ending on June 30, 2018 note that China Eximbank withdrew $19,806 from one of the escrow accounts between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2018 as a penalty for the borrower’s ‘late repayment of [a] due installment’.

However, the ADB did not follow up on the project due to its marginal financial viability and its potentially serious environmental and social impacts, especially on migratory fish stocks and fishing livelihoods. Then, in June 2007, the Ministry of Industry, Mines, and Energy (MIME) of Cambodia granted permission for Electricité du Viet Nam (EVN) to conduct a detailed feasibility study. The study was implemented by a consulting firm, Power Engineering Consulting Joint Stock Company 1 (PECC1), in collaboration and consultation with technical ministries/agencies of the Royal Government of Cambodia. Then, on November 26, 2012, The Government of Cambodia and Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and joint venture of the Royal Group of Cambodia (39%), Hydrolancang International Energy (51%), and Vietnam Electricity (EVN) (10%) — signed an implementation agreement (IA) for the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project. On the same day, Électricité du Cambodge (EDC) and Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). Under these two agreements, Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. was granted a 45-year concession (40 years of operation and a construction period of 5 years) and it was specified that the electricity generated by Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. — through the Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant — would be sold to EDC at the fixed price of 6.95 US cents per kilowatt-hour. These agreements also specified that, after 40 years of operation, the ownership of the Lower Sesan II dam will be transferred to the Government of Cambodia. On December 12, 2012, the Government of Cambodia also agreed to guarantee the payment (power purchase) obligations of EDC and Cambodia’s Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy to Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd under the PPA and the IA.  The total cost of the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project, which was implemented on a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) basis, was $978 million and it was financed with a mix of debt and equity. In December 2013, China Development Bank (captured via Project ID#62217), ICBC (captured via Project ID#92481), and Bank of China (captured via Project ID#92483) provided a $781 million debt financing package (with a 17-year maturity and an interest rate of 6.5%) to Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. for the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project. The financing was structured in the 2 tranches: (i) an initial bridge financing with ICBC under a financial leasing structure (the first for an infrastructure project in Cambodia); and (ii) a subsequent project financing by China Development Bank and Bank of China. Sinosure provided credit insurance. The Government of Cambodia issued a sovereign guarantee in the event on non-payment by EDC.  The purpose of this project was to construct a hydroelectric power plant in the northeastern province of Stung Treng on the Se San River. Its locational coordinates are 13°32′59.5″N 106°15′49.4″E. The Lower Sesan II Dam is 80 meters tall and occupies a 36,000-hectare plot. The plant has eight turbines and each turbine has an installed capacity of 50 megawatts (400 MW total capacity). Upon completion, the plant was expected to produce 1.9 billion kilowatt-hours per year, boost electricity production in the country by 20%, and bring installed hydropower capacity to 1328MW.  PowerChina HuaDong Engineering Corporation Limited (HDEC) was the contractor responsible for project design. Sinohydro Bureau 8 Co., Ltd was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began in December 2013. The watergate was officially closed on September 25, 2017. The first turbine began producing electricity in November 2017. The dam was officially opened on December 18, 2018.   The Chinese banks that financed the project divided environmental and social risks control into specific segments, including pre-loan investigation, loan review, contract management, loan issuance and post-loan management. They also required an environmental impact assessment (EIA) after the completion of the project. CDB went even further by introducing a standard review procedure. Sinosure also required that the project developer pay special attention to social and environmental responsibilities -- in particular, by resolving controversies around the dam through public consultation. The project developer held several public consultations with the affected communities in line with the guidelines of the Chinese banks. In July 2015, as requested by the local staff members of the CDB, the project developer held a dialogue with 140 people representing communities affected by the 400MW Lower Sesan II hydropower plant, Cambodian government representatives at national and sub-national levels, and NGOs to discuss their concerns and other issues related to the project. The participants then paid a visit on July 27, 2014 to the resettlement site to inspect on the quality of the housing construction, agricultural land, and dam construction. During the visit, community representatives and media held an informal on-site dialogue and raised questions to the Ministry of Mine and Energy’s secretary of state, project development, and the Stung Treng Deputy Governor in charge of Resettlement and Compensation Committee.   Nevertheless, the project was affected by protests from thousands of villagers who were at risk of being displaced or losing their livelihoods. On February 13, 2014, villagers living in the dam reservoir lodged a petition to the Chinese embassy in Phnom Penh, relevant ministries of the Cambodian government, and the developer to discuss compensation and resettlement conditions in detail. On August 10, 2021, Human Rights Watch released a report about the various ways in which the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project allegedly harmed the lives and livelihoods of thousands of indigenous and ethnic minority people. The report claims that the construction of the Lower Sesan 2 dam displaced nearly 5,000 people without adequately providing compensation or livelihood assistance. It also notes that, although by community members occurred during the dam’s construction between 2011 and 2018, public officials ignored the complaints and moved forward with the construction project.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Other Joint Venture/Special Purpose Vehicle|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company",293665515.74966,"This project involved the construction of a 400MW hydroelectric power plant in northeastern province of Stung Treng on the Se San River.

The study was implemented by a consulting firm, Power Engineering Consulting Joint Stock Company 1 (PECC1), in collaboration and consultation with technical ministries/agencies of the Royal Government of Cambodia. Then, on November 26, 2012, The Government of Cambodia and Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and joint venture of the Royal Group of Cambodia (39%), Hydrolancang International Energy (51%), and Vietnam Electricity (EVN) (10%) — signed an implementation agreement (IA) for the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project. On the same day, Électricité du Cambodge (EDC) and Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). Under these two agreements, Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. was granted a 45-year concession (40 years of operation and a construction period of 5 years) and it was specified that the electricity generated by Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. — through the Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant — would be sold to EDC at the fixed price of 6.95 US cents per kilowatt-hour. These agreements also specified that, after 40 years of operation, the ownership of the Lower Sesan II dam will be transferred to the Government of Cambodia. On December 12, 2012, the Government of Cambodia also agreed to guarantee the payment (power purchase) obligations of EDC and Cambodia’s Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy to Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd under the PPA and the IA.  The total cost of the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project, which was implemented on a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) basis, was $978 million and it was financed with a mix of debt and equity. In December 2013, China Development Bank (captured via Project ID#62217), ICBC (captured via Project ID#92481), and Bank of China (captured via Project ID#92483) provided a $781 million debt financing package (with a 17-year maturity and an interest rate of 6.5%) to Hydro Power Lower Sesan 2 Co., Ltd. for the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project. The financing was structured in the 2 tranches: (i) an initial bridge financing with ICBC under a financial leasing structure (the first for an infrastructure project in Cambodia); and (ii) a subsequent project financing by China Development Bank and Bank of China. Sinosure provided credit insurance. The Government of Cambodia issued a sovereign guarantee in the event on non-payment by EDC.  The purpose of this project was to construct a hydroelectric power plant in the northeastern province of Stung Treng on the Se San River. Its locational coordinates are 13°32′59.5″N 106°15′49.4″E. The Lower Sesan II Dam is 80 meters tall and occupies a 36,000-hectare plot. The plant has eight turbines and each turbine has an installed capacity of 50 megawatts (400 MW total capacity). Upon completion, the plant was expected to produce 1.9 billion kilowatt-hours per year, boost electricity production in the country by 20%, and bring installed hydropower capacity to 1328MW.  PowerChina HuaDong Engineering Corporation Limited (HDEC) was the contractor responsible for project design. Sinohydro Bureau 8 Co., Ltd was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began in December 2013. The watergate was officially closed on September 25, 2017. The first turbine began producing electricity in November 2017. The dam was officially opened on December 18, 2018.   The Chinese banks that financed the project divided environmental and social risks control into specific segments, including pre-loan investigation, loan review, contract management, loan issuance and post-loan management. They also required an environmental impact assessment (EIA) after the completion of the project. CDB went even further by introducing a standard review procedure. Sinosure also required that the project developer pay special attention to social and environmental responsibilities -- in particular, by resolving controversies around the dam through public consultation. The project developer held several public consultations with the affected communities in line with the guidelines of the Chinese banks. In July 2015, as requested by the local staff members of the CDB, the project developer held a dialogue with 140 people representing communities affected by the 400MW Lower Sesan II hydropower plant, Cambodian government representatives at national and sub-national levels, and NGOs to discuss their concerns and other issues related to the project. The participants then paid a visit on July 27, 2014 to the resettlement site to inspect on the quality of the housing construction, agricultural land, and dam construction. During the visit, community representatives and media held an informal on-site dialogue and raised questions to the Ministry of Mine and Energy’s secretary of state, project development, and the Stung Treng Deputy Governor in charge of Resettlement and Compensation Committee.   Nevertheless, the project was affected by protests from thousands of villagers who were at risk of being displaced or losing their livelihoods. On February 13, 2014, villagers living in the dam reservoir lodged a petition to the Chinese embassy in Phnom Penh, relevant ministries of the Cambodian government, and the developer to discuss compensation and resettlement conditions in detail. On August 10, 2021, Human Rights Watch released a report about the various ways in which the 400MW Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant Project allegedly harmed the lives and livelihoods of thousands of indigenous and ethnic minority people. The report claims that the construction of the Lower Sesan 2 dam displaced nearly 5,000 people without adequately providing compensation or livelihood assistance. It also notes that, although by community members occurred during the dam’s construction between 2011 and 2018, public officials ignored the complaints and moved forward with the construction project.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Commercial Bank","Other Joint Venture/Special Purpose Vehicle|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company",293665515.74966,"This project involved the construction of a 400MW hydroelectric power plant in northeastern province of Stung Treng on the Se San River.

This is an independent power project (IPP) under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).  In August 2016, Pakistan’s Private Power & Infrastructure Board (PPIB) awarded TNPTL a letter of intent (LOI) for the Phase 2 of the 330 MW Thar Block 2 (TEL 2) Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project. Then, in December 2016, PPIB issued a Letter of Support (LOS) to TNPTL, which was late amended in August 2017. It required TNPTL to achieve Financial Close (FC) for the project and enter an Implementation Agreement (IA), Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), Water Use Agreement, Coal Supply Agreement, and Land Lease Deed. TNPTL executed an Implementation Agreement with PPIB in November 2017 and Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Pakistan’s Central Power Purchase Authority (Guarantee) Limited (CPPA-G) — the power plant’s off-taker — in July 2017.  It also signed a Water Use Agreement with Government of Sindh, a Coal Supply Agreement with Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company Limited (SECMC), and a Land Lease Deed for the purchase of 244 acres of land.   On April 27, 2019, a consortium of banks and TNPTL signed two syndicated loan agreements worth USD 373 million for Phase 2 of the 330 MW Thar Block 2 (TEL 2) Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project: 1) a USD-denominated syndicated export buyer's credit loan facility agreement with China Development Bank (CDB), China Minsheng Bank, China Zheshang Bank; and 2) a PKR-denominated loan facility with Habib Bank Limited, the lead arranger for local financing, and other Pakistani banks. CDB, the lead arranger for foreign financing, contributed USD 262 million to the USD-denominated syndicated loan facility. The estimated borrowing terms of this foreign loan facility are as follows: a 10-year maturity, a 3.33-year grace period, an interest rate of 4.95%, and a 5% Sinosure insurance premium. Additionally, as a source of security (collateral) for the syndicated loan from CDB, China Minsheng Bank, and China Zheshang Bank, the owners of TNPTL pledged their shares (equity stakes) in the project company.  The total cost of Phase 2 of the 330 MW Thar Block 2 (TEL 2) Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project is USD 497 million and it is financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25. Therefore, the remaining project cost (USD 124 million) was provided by the project sponsors — HUBCO, Thal Limited, Novatex, CMEC, and Descon Engineering Limited — via equity infusions. On July 22, 2019, TNPTL executed additional financing documents with its foreign and local lenders. Then, on September 30, 2020, the project achieved financial closure. The proceeds of the loans were to be used by the borrower to finance an Engineering, Procurement, Construction (EPC) contract between TNPTL and CMEC, which was signed on April 10, 2017.    The purpose of Phase 2 was to construct a 330MW mine-mouth lignite-fired power plant in the energy park within Thar Block-II in Sindh Province. CMEC was one of the EPC contractors responsible for implementation. TNPTL gave Limited Notice to Proceed (LNTP) to its EPC Contractors on March 12, 2019. However, construction did not begin until May 2019. The originally expected Commercial Operations Date (COD) was March 31, 2021. However, on January 31, 2020, CMEC notified TNPTL of a Force Majeure Event (FME) due to outbreak of Coronavirus (COVID–19) in China and across the globe. The expected COD for Phase 2 was revised to January 12, 2022. By the end of 2020, Phase 2 had only achieved a 34% completion rate. As of July 2022, the progress rate had reached 51%.

The Ethiopian House of Representatives ratified the PBC agreement on February 7, 2017 under Proclamation No. 1000/2017. The proclamation went into effect on February 22. 2017.  The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 12 year maturity, a 3 year grace period, and a 2.43% interest rate. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the PBC to partially finance a commercial (EPC) contract between Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCo), China Energy Engineering Corporation Limited (CEEC), and Xinjiang Electric Power Design Institute, which was signed in September 2014 and modified on August 22, 2015.   China Eximbank made 8 loan disbursements (worth $212,287,364.45 or ETB 5,650,372,288) between 2017 and 2019: a $124,304,105.62 disbursement on July 20, 2017, a $30,530,211.81 disbursement on August 18, 2017, a $23,090,272.81 disbursement on November 23, 2017, a $7,237,606.93 disbursement on December 8, 2017, a $4,070,685.80 disbursement on December 18, 2017, a $11,054,217.02 disbursement on June 14, 2018, a $3,806,431.81 disbursement on August 3, 2018, and a $8,193,832.65 disbursement on September 11, 2019.   The project involved the construction of a 355 km, 400kV transmission line from the Genale Dawa III substation to the Yirga Alem II substation and the Wolayita Sodo II substation and Hawassa II substation. $195 million of the loan proceeds was earmarked for construction of the transmission line, while the remaining $54 million was earmarked for construction of the substations.   Xinjiang Electric Power Design Institute and CEEC were the general EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. Sichuan Electric Power Transmission and Transformation Construction Co., Ltd. was also involved (most likely as a subcontractor).  Construction began in November 2015 and the project was completed on May 5, 2017.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Genale Dawa III-Yirga Alem II-Wolayita Sodo II-Hawassa II Power Transmission Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges.

The communication satellite was to be constructed with 30 year transponders, 12 in C-Band and 18 in Ku-Band, each of 36 MHz Bandwidth. Then, in September 2009, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a framework agreement (captured via Project ID#72713). Under the terms of the framework agreement, China Eximbank agreed to provide up to RMB 1.385 billion for the Paksat-1R Project. Any subsidiary loans under this framework agreement would bear the following terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 0.2% commitment fee, and a 0.2% management fee.   Shortly thereafter, on October 15, 2009, Deputy Director of the China Eximbank and the Pakistani Ambassador to China signed a RMB 1,350,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO.

The proceeds of the GCLs were on-lent from the Government of Pakistan to the National Space Agency of Pakistan (SUPARCO) at a 15% interest rate.  Paksat-1R, a DFH-4-type satellite, was constructed by the Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO) and the China Great Wall Industry Corporation (CGWIC). On August 12, 2011, at the Chinese Xichang Satellite Launch Center, Pakistan’s first Communications Satellite PAKSAT-1R, as part of Pakistan’s Space Programme 2040, was launched. The launch was witnessed by Pakistani Secretary Defence Lt Gen Syed Athar Ali (R), Secretary Foreign Affairs, Salman Bashir, Director General, Strategic Plans Division Lt Gen Khalid Ahmed Kidwai (R) and Ambassador of Pakistan to China, Muhammad Masood Khan. Launched on the Long March 3B rocket, the Paksat-1R satellite has a design life of 15 years with initial goals to provide broadband internet access, digital television broadcasting, remote and rural telephony, emergency communications, tele-education and tele-medicine services across South and Central Asia, Eastern Europe, East Africa and the Far East. The satellite successfully took over the operations of its predecessor, the PakSat-1E satellite leased by Pakistan, in geostationary orbit at 38° East.  The commercial services of the satellite were inaugurated by the Prime Minister of Pakistan on November 5, 2011 from the satellite ground station located near Lahore. On November 11, 2011, the ground control center was transferred to the Pakistani side for its use.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank government concessional loans for the Paksat-1R Satellite System Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. in 2020, reports emerged SUPARCO was unable to repay the China Eximbank loans for the RSSS Project. SUPARCO sought relief from a panel consisting of the Federal Minister of Planning, Development & Special Initiatives, the Federal Minister for Industries & Production, and the Advisor to PM on Finance and Revenue on October 12, 2020. The panel viewed SUPARCO’s case favorably and recommended that it be approved by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC). At that time, it was proposed that SUPARCO be allowed to repay the loans at a 2% rather than a 15% interest rate. Then, on or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement.

The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. The proceeds from the PBC were used to be used by the borrower finance 85% of the cost of a $286.94 million commercial civil works contract between the Government of Zambia and AVIC International, which was signed on December 31, 2009. The Government of Zambia was responsible for funding the remainder (15%) of the project cost.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 34 km road section (D819) from Mongu to Tapo on the Mongu-Kalabo Road. It also involved the construction of twenty five bridges, the construction of 1022 meter bridges across Zambezi River, constructions of crushed stone base, bituminous surfacing, ancillaries like road markings, traffic signs, kilometer posts, guard rails, and erosion protection works. AVIC International Holding Corporation was the contractor responsible for implementation.   A groundbreaking ceremony took place and October 17, 2010 and the project was officially completed and handed over to the authorities on April 27, 2016. The road has been open and operational ever since. However, this project has face accusations of corruption and overpricing. In a 2021 SAIS-CARI working paper (entitled ""How Zambia and China Co-Created a Debt ""Tragedy of the Commons""), Deborah Brautigam writes at some length about the project: “[t]he Zambezi River runs through Zambia’s Western Province. During the rainy season, the river spills across the Barotse floodplain, a seasonal wetland of some 550,000 hectares. Jill Kandel, an American who lived in rural Mongu for six years with her Dutch agronomist husband, told me what traveling from Mongu to the provincial capital of Kalabo, 57 km away as the crow flies, was like before the road. ‘It was a daunting, full-day, hot trip. For six months of the year the river would flood and you had to move north or south to a pontoon ferry. Each way it was a five-hour trip, just to get to the ferry. In the dry season, you could travel on the Zambezi, but it would take eight to ten hours on a banana boat with a 35 hp motor.’   A paved road through this section of the Western Province linking Zambia to Angola has been a dream for successive Zambian governments. In the late 1990s, the OPEC Fund provided US$ 27.3 million for a road. Launched in 2000 by a Kuwaiti firm, the project collapsed when floods in 2003 and 2004 washed out the embankments built by the company. In October 2010, leading up to a critical election year, AVIC--a Chinese firm with roots in the aviation industry, but with ambitious goals of adding global engineering, procurement, construction (EPC) projects to its portfolio--was able to negotiate funding from China Eximbank for its single-source bid to build the 34 km road for US$ 287 million. A well-known Chinese saying asserts ‘to become prosperous, first build a road.’ China Eximbank, which provided a preferential export buyer’s credit for the project, does not appear to have questioned the Zambian argument that the road had developmental benefits beyond those reflected in a traditional economic analysis. As a Zambian official told C. K. Lee: ‘It’s extremely expensive. No European bank would finance it, but with China, we agreed that it’s important for Zambia and Angola… You cannot drive from Zambia to Angola; you cannot because there is no road. For the benefit of SADC [Southern African Development Community] we have to open up this part of Africa.’ Rumors circulated in Lusaka that the project’s costs were padded to allow President Rupiah Banda and the MMD [ruling part] to finance the 2011 election campaign, which, ironically, he lost to China’s chief critic at the time: Michael Sata of the PF [an opposition part]. Yet the technical achievement of the road, with its 26 bridges, remained impressive. The road ‘totally blew me away,’ Jill Kandel recalled. ‘It’s like I was living on the moon and someone built a stairway.’ Still, videos of the road posted by travelers show little traffic aside from bicycles and pedestrians. Beyond Kalabo, a sandy track remains the only way to reach Angola.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company",300090764.247271,"The purpose of the project was to construct a 34 km road section (D819) from Mongu to Tapo on the Mongu-Kalabo Road.

The total estimated cost of this public-private partnership (PPP) project is $891 million and it is being financed with a mix of debt and equity. On July 24, 2019, China Development Bank (Shandong Branch) and Autopistas Urabá S.A.S. — a project company (special purpose vehicle) that is jointly owned by China Harbour Engineering Company Limited Colombia (65% equity stake), SP Ingenieros S.A.S. (20% equity stake), Unidad de Infraestructura y Construcciones Asociadas S.A.S. or UNICA (15% equity stake), and Termotécnica Coindustrial S.A.S. (5% equity stake) — signed a $417.7 million loan agreement for the Autopista al Mar 2 Project. CDB provided the loan proceeds in two separate tranches: a $267.7 million tranche (known as Tranche A) with a 12 year maturity, an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3.05% margin (during the construction phase), a 2% management fee, a 1.2% commitment fee, and a 0.54% arrangement fee (captured via Project ID#54591); and a $150 million tranche (known as Tranche B) with a 16 year maturity, an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 2.95% margin (during the construction phase), a 2% management fee, a 1.2% commitment fee, and a 0.54% arrangement fee (captured via Project ID#89458). As a source of security (collateral), the Government of Colombia guaranteed a minimum level of toll collection revenue (known as VPIP) over a 25-29 year period. In total, Autopistas Urabá S.A. secured approximately $652 million of debt financing for the Autopista al Mar 2 Project, including an $84 million loan from Sumitomo Mitsui Bank Corporation (SMBC) and a COP 500 billion (approximately $150 million) loan from Financiera de Desarrollo Nacional S. A. (FDN). The SMBC loan carries a 16 year maturity and an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3.05% margin (during construction). The FDN loan carries a 16 year maturity an interest rate of CPI plus a 7.5% margin.  The loan proceeds are to be used by the borrower (Autopistas Urabá S.A.S.) to finance a commercial (EPC) contract that it signed with a consortium (consisting of China Harbour Engineering Company Limited Colombia, SP Ingenieros S.A.S., Unidad de Infraestructura y Construcciones Asociadas S.A.S., and Termotécnica Coindustrial S.A.S.) on July 17, 2019. Paul Hastings LLP was the law firm that represented the syndicate of lenders. With trade tensions between the US and China escalating, CHEC took the decision to switch the documentation for the deal from New York law to English law. The switch meant taking on new sets of lawyers and making sure the contract documentation aligned with English law. The Autopista al Mar 2 Project involves a 254 km toll road that will connect Cañasgordas to Necoclí, in Antioquía, a department in north-west Colombia. Under the terms of the concession agreement, Autopistas Urabá S.A.S. is responsible for upgrading the section of the highway between Cañasgordas and Uramita (28km); constructing a new highway segment between Uramita and Dabeiba (17.7km), while operating and maintaining the existing road connection; upgrading the road linking Dabeiba to Mutatá (53km); rehabiliating the highway linking Mutatá to El Tigre (47km); and operatiing and maintaining the existing highway between El Tigre and Necoclí (106km). The Autopista al Mar 2 project also involves the construction of 62 bridges and 12 tunnel stretches. China Harbour Engineering Company Limited Colombia, SP Ingenieros S.A.S., Unidad de Infraestructura y Construcciones Asociadas S.A.S., and Termotécnica Coindustrial S.A.S are the EPC contractors responsible for implementation.

The proclamation went into effect on August 3; 2017.   The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $300 million commercial (EPC) contract with China Geo-engineering Construction Overseas Company Group (CGCOC).  The purpose of the project was to construct a 122 hectare industrial park — in the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Port Industrial Economic Corridor — that will house at least 18 Chinese enterprises that produce heavy machinery and power equipment. More specifically, it involved the construction of access roads and utilities, factories, office spaces, and related infrastructure. The Adama (Ethiopia-Hunan) Machinery and Industrial Park is located on 300 hectares of land near the city of Adama and is about 100 kilometres to the south-east of the capital Addis Ababa. It is 2 km from the Ethiopia-Djibouti Railway Adama Station, and 300 meters from the Addis-Adama Expressway Exit.   CGCOC was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) was also involved (most likely as a subcontractor).

To repay and secure these borrowings, the framework agreement specifies that a Crude Oil Sales Agreement between Iraq's state-owned oil marketing company (SOMO or شركة تسويق النفط) and an unspecified Chinese oil importer, wherein SOMO agrees to sell no fewer than 100,000 barrels of crude oil per day to the Chinese oil importer and the Chinese oil importer agrees to make payments to SOMO due under the Crude Oil Sales Agreement by depositing U.S. dollars (or another foreign currency) in a Sinosure-designated and lender-controlled bank (escrow) account (that is opened on behalf of the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Iraq to facilitate debt repayment).  Under the terms of the framework agreement, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Iraq is required to maintain a minimum cash balance of $100 million in a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) and pledge the DSRA in favor of Sinosure. Apart from the DSRA, the framework agreement refers to two additional escrow accounts: an Oil Settlement Account and a Repayment Account. All oil sale proceeds first flow to the Oil Settlement Account. Then, after deductions are made by the United Nations Compensation Commission for compensation due to Kuwait, the remaining revenue flows to the Repayment Account (so long as there is still a $100 million minimum cash balance in the DSRA) and principal and interest payments to lenders are made from the Repayment Account.  On September 23, 2019, account agreement and oil agreement annexes to the framework agreement were finalized. Then, on September 23, 2019, the framework agreement officially went into effect. Approximately 15 months later, in December 2020, a Financial Advisor to Iraq’s Prime Minister, Dr. Mudhar Muhammad Salih, told the Iraqi News Agency (INA), that Iraq’s House of Representatives would need to identify the specific projects to be funded under the framework agreement and allocate funds for these projects in the Federal Budget Law. He also signaled at the time that the Iraqi Government planned to borrow through the export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure to fund the construction of school buildings. Then, in June 2021, he announced that the 2021 Federal Budget Law included $2 billion for projects to be financed through the export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure, which had entered into force. 5 months later, in November 2021, he told a local newspaper that several Chinese companies had deposited $1.8 billion in an account and the funds would be used to support the construction of 1,000 schools as well as ‘infrastructure and renewable power projects’. This announcement implies that the Government of Iraq ultimately decided to borrowed via commercial contracts with deferred payment clauses (i.e. supplier’s credits) with Chinese companies rather than buyer’s credit facilities with PRC banks. On June 30, 2022, Dr. Mudhar Muhammad Salih said that ‘[t]he operations of depositing money and withdrawing from the [escrow] account are continuing for the benefit of the projects concluded within the [export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure].’ He also noted that ‘the [escrow] account is managed very carefully by the Central Bank of Iraq, and the financial operations are audited by the major international financial auditing companies.’  There are three known projects — supported by four separate commercial contracts — that are being financed under the export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure: the 1260MW Salah Al-Din Oil-fired Thermal Power Plant Construction Project, the Construction of 1000 Schools Project, and the Al-Nasiriyah International Airport Renovation and Expansion Project.  On June 8, 2021, the Government of Iraq and China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) signed a $367 million commercial (EPC) contract for the Al-Nasiriyah International Airport Renovation and Expansion Project. The estimated monetary value of the supplier’s credit for the project is $311.95 million (as captured via Project ID#95985). The Al-Nasiriyah International Airport Renovation and Expansion Project involves (a) the expansion and renovation of an international airport (with a 5000 square meters freight building) in the town of Nasiriyah that, upon completion, will have the capacity the handle 750,000 travelers a year; and (b) the construction of a 25 kilometers long road linking the airport and the Dhi Qar governorate center. The airport served as an Iraqi Air Force base (also known as Talil Air Base) until 2011, after which it served U.S. forces as the Imam Ali Air Base until March 2017. CSCEC is the contractor responsible for project implementation.

The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 20-year maturity, a 2% interest rate, a 5-year grace period, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee. The PBC was to be repaid in thirty semi-annual installments. On January 9, 2014, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the PBC. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 90% of the $306,211,479.18 cost of a commercial (EPC) contract [ID#29-01-135] that it signed with Sinohydro Corporation Limited on June 5, 2012. The PBC’s outstanding (principal) amount as of December 31, 2019 was $206,576,311.   The purpose of this project was to construct a 47-km long and 29-meter wide highway — with two lanes in both directions — between the city of Miladinovci and the city of Štip (which is Macedonia's largest eastern city). Upon completion, it was envisaged that this project — one part of Pan-European Corridor No. 8 — would reduce the distance between Skopje and Štip by more than 15 km. Sinohydro Bureau 7. Co.

A feasibility study and a site topographical survey and soil investigation work for the project were completed in October 2011. Front-end engineering design (FEED) and environmental impact assessment studies were also completed. In April 2014, the Petronas board of directors approved the final investment decision (FID) for the RAPID project. Construction of the facilities began in 2014 and was completed in November 2018. The refinery’s diesel hydrotreating unit attained ‘Ready For Start Up (RFSU)’ status in February 2019. However, in April 2019, the project was shut down for safety checks after a fire broke out at the atmospheric residue desulphurisation (ARDS) unit. The CDU was restarted in August 2019.  The refinery achieved its first production of ultra-low sulphur diesel on August 9, 2019. Then, on November 22, 2019, Pengerang Refining and Petrochemical (PRefChem) achieved a major milestone with the lifting of 300,000 barrels of diesel from its refinery in Pengerang. This was the 5th lifting of diesel products since the refinery’s Diesel Hydrotreating Unit attained RFSU status. The project was originally expected to reach its commercial operations date (COD) during second half of 2020 and accelerate the growth of Malaysia’s oil and gas downstream sector. However, it has encountered several implementation delays. Upon completion, the project is expected to employ 70,000 workers during construction and generate 4,000 new jobs.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Commercial Bank",NA,317407002.964054,"The purpose of the project is to construct a refinery in Pengerang within the state of Johor with the capacity to process 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and produce refined products, including Euro 5 gasoline and diesel, as well as feedstock for production of 3.3 million tons per annum (mtpa) of petrochemical products.

Bank of China's contribution to the syndicate is captured via Project ID#89647. The loan carried a 2-year maturity and an unknown interest rate.  The loan was secured by (i.e. collateralized against) trust pledges on the assets of Empresa de Generación Huallaga SA, a trust over the cash flows of Empresa de Generación Huallaga SA, and accounts and shares issued by the borrower. The Bank of New York Mellon acted as offshore collateral agent, while Scotiabank Perú acted as onshore agent and trustee and ICBC Perú acted as debt and equity escrow agent.  The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to (a) acquire Empresa de Generación Huallaga S.A. (EGH) from Odebrecht Energía del Perú SA and Odebrecht Energía SA for $1.39 billion; and (b) pay off the liabilities of EGH to a bank syndicate (consisting of Inter-American Development Bank, BNDES, and Deutsche Bank) that financed the hydroelectric plant during the project’s greenfield stage.

Then, on October 9, 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cote d'Ivoire signed a $285,928,798.53 (CFA 171,557,279,118) preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2019) 11 TOTAL NO. (494)] for the 112MW Gribo Popoli Hydropower Plant Construction Project. The PBC agreement was ratified by the Ivorian Government on January 8, 2020. It entered into force on March 9, 2020. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower is expected to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance 85% of the cost of a $336,386,821.80 commercial contract between the Government of Cote d'Ivoire and SinoHydro 5th Bureau, which was signed in November 2017. The Government of Cote d'Ivoire is also responsible for directly financing 15% ($50,458,023.27) of the commercial contract cost.   According to the Government of Cote d'Ivoire's Aid Management Platform (AMP), the China Eximbank loan had achieved a 52.7% disbursement rate (CFA 90,460,393,884.86 out of CFA 171,557,279,118) as of December 31, 2022. 6 China Eximbank loan disbursements (worth CFA 90,460,393,884.86) were made between 2021 and 2022: a CFA 28,025,899,865 disbursement on July 31, 2021, and a CFA 15,963,581,178.86 disbursement on December 31, 2021, a CFA 14,016,023,361 disbursement on March 31, 2022, a CFA 6,297,699,749 disbursement on June 30, 2022, a CFA 12,963,496,194 disbursement on August 31, 2022, and a CFA 13,193,693,537 on December 31, 2022.       The purpose of the project is to construct a 112.3 MW hydroelectric power plant in Gribo Popoli on the Sassandra River (downstream from Buyo dam site and the Soubré dam site) and 10 km of transmission lines. The project also has a ‘project management’ component, involving an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA), a Resettlement Action Plant (RAP) and an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP). Upon completion, the power plant is expected to generate 580 gigawatt hours of electricity output.   SinoHydro 5th Bureau is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on November 2, 2017. However, construction of the access road to the project site did not begin until January 2018. Several months later, in March 2018, construction of the diversion cofferdam and site facilities commenced. The ESIA was launched in May 2018, and the first compensation payments to displaced households were also made during calendar year 2018. The Government of Cote d'Ivoire issued an advance payment to SinoHydro 5th Bureau in May 2020. However, it was not until October 11, 2021 that the construction team began to assemble the power plant and the dam. Construction of the power plant and the dam began on October 27, 2021.   Project implementation is running behind schedule. The project was originally expected to reach completion within 40 months (estimated end date: May 2021). According to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the borrowing institution was delayed in its (advance) payment of $50,458,023.27 to the EPC contractor.

On December 28, 2018, a syndicate of banks — including Bank of China (Qingdao Branch) as an arranger, lender, and original hedging bank, Bank of China Limited (Singapore Branch) as a lender, facility agent, offshore security agent, and offshore account bank, China Development Bank (CDB) as an arranger and lender, China Construction Bank (Shandong Branch) as an arranger, lender, original hedging bank, Agricultural Bank of China (Qingdao Branch) as a lender, China Minsheng Bank (Qingdao Branch) as a lender, and Rupali Bank Limited as a lender, onshore security agent, and onshore account bank — signed a $1.782 billion USD syndicated buyer’s credit agreement with SS Power I Limited for the 2x660 MW Supercritical Coal-Fired Banskhali Power Plant Project. The buyer’s credit carried a 15-year maturity and an unknown interest rate. It was also supported by a Sinosure credit insurance policy and secured by (collateralized against) a share pledge, account pledge, a mortgage and debenture. AidData estimates that Bank of China contributed $296,666,666.7 (captured in Project ID#52792), CCB contributed $296,666,666.7 (captured in Project ID#98804), CDB contributed $296,666,666.7 (captured in Project ID#98814), and that ABC also contributed $296,666,666.7 (captured in Project ID#98815).  The borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to finance (a) 85% of the cost a $1.86 billion commercial (EPC) contract between S. Alam Group and SEPCO III, which was signed on June 29, 2015; and (b) 85% of the cost of the Sinosure premium and interest during construction under the senior buyer’s credit facility. The syndicated loan covered 71.1% of the total project cost. S. Alam Group, SEPCO III, and HTG Development Group Co. Ltd. were expected to cover the remaining 28.9% via equity contributions. Project ID#52792 captures the debt financing for the project, while Project ID#54275 captures the equity financing for the project.  The purpose of the project was to construct a supercritical coal-fired power plant — with two 660 MW supercritical power generation units — and a new special coal unloading wharf in Paschim Gandamara within Banskhali Upzila and Chittagong Division (exact locational coordinates: 21.970844, 91.888932). The IPP is governed by the terms of an Implementation Agreement (IA) and a 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) executed with Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB).  SEPCO III is the general engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor responsible for project implementation. However, several other contractors are also involved in the project. Dongfang Electric Corporation is responsible for providing the turbine generators, while Babcock & Wilcox Beijing Co., Ltd. is responsible for providing the boiler equipment. Sinohydro Foundation Engineering Co., Ltd. is also involved in project implementation. A formal project unveiling ceremony took place on October 14, 2016, with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina laying the plant's foundation. However, project implementation did not begin until significantly later. A notice to proceed (NTP) was issued to the EPC contractor on December 10, 2018, and project implementation commenced on December 31, 2018. As stipulated in the EPC contract, the project completion date was scheduled to fall between 39 and 40 months (March 31, 2022 or April 30, 2022) after the EPC commencement date and the NTP date.  The construction of the Banskhali Power Plant has been the source of significant, often violent, controversy in Bangladesh. Villagers opposed to the plant began peaceful protests during the S. Alam Group's land acquisition efforts, decrying the displacement because of the plant's construction. Then, on April 4, 2016, 500 villagers gathered on the grounds of Gondamara School to protest against the construction of the plant, despite local authorities having banned the demonstration. The demonstration turned violent, as police opened fire, killing four protesters and wounding 30 more. Then, in early February 2017, at a community meeting in Abhaittya Ghona in Banskhali, sponsored by the Bangladesh Navy, the S. Alam Group, and local authorities, clashes broke out between pro and anti-plant factions (which were composed of followers of a local Awami League leader and Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader, respectively) that led to the death of a pro-plant man and injured 16 more. After the clashes, the Bangladesh Navy began to supervise the project site's security along the local police.  In July 2020, the sponsors of the project were fined ৳2,000,000,000 BDT for delays in the construction works and received a two-year extension to the project period. Then, on April 17, 2021, clashes erupted between the Banskhali police and construction workers at the plant, supported by local people. The workers had been protesting over unpaid wages. The resulting altercation saw the police kill five workers and critically wound a dozen more. During the protest, workers committed arson and vandalism in the construction period. Two more workers died of their injuries, raising the death toll to seven. The next month, on May 28, 2021, police arrested a local Bangladeshi engineer for posting an anti-power plant message on Facebook under Bangladesh's Digital Security Act.  One cause of the resistance to the power plant is allegations from local residents near the power plant that the S. Alam Group bought their land to construct a garment factory to increase local employment, not a polluting power plant. The resistance was reportedly so strong that the S. Alam Group was willing to shift the entire plant to Chokoria if it could not convince the locals to support the plant. Another cause of protests was the environmental impact of the plant. An analysis of the air quality segment of the project's Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) by the Helsinki-based Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, in collaboration with the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers Association and the Bangladesh Working Group on External Debt, found that the EIA was filled with false information and omitted key details, in violation of the laws of Bangladesh. For example, the EIA failed to discuss the health impacts of the plant or mercy pollution, and falsely claimed that the air quality in Banskhali met Bangladeshi standards. The conclusions of the review suggested that the low-quality of the EIA was either the result of gross incompetence or deliberate manipulation. In a June 2021 letter to China's Commerce Minister, 129 activists and 79 organizations from 21 countries, including a number of well-known Bangladeshi figures, asked the Chinese Government to withdraw financing and technical support from the Banskhali Power Plant Project based on the project's lack of transparency, violations of human rights, and environmental damage.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Commercial Bank","Other Joint Venture/Special Purpose Vehicle|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Private Sector|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company",323322091.907002,"This project supports the construction of a power plant located in Paschim Gandamara in Banskhali Upzila of Chittagong Division.

This resources-credit cooperation package is backed by future revenues from the sale of oil exports. Each subsidiary buyer’s credit loan (BCL) issued through the framework agreement carries a 15-year maturity and 5.6% interest rate.  On April 4, 2010, China Eximbank reportedly agreed in principle to finance a $274 million South Kordofan 220kV Power Transmission and Distribution Project through this non-concessional master framework agreement. However, on October 8, 2010, China Eximbank and the Government of Sudan signed a $233 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for this project, which carried a different set of concessional borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity and 3% interest rate. The proceeds from this PBC were used to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $274 million commercial contract between China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC) and the National Electricity Corporation (NEC) of Sudan, which was signed on July 4, 2009.  The project involved the construction of an electricity transmission line than runs from the city of El-Obeid (in central Sudan within North Kordofan State) to a power plant in Al-Fulah (or al-Fula or EI Fula or الفولة) in West Kordofan State. The 405 MW Al-Fulah Gas-Fired Power Plant Construction Project was funded through a separate China Eximbank BCL (as captured via Project ID#1007). The ultimate goal was to supply power to Northern and Southern Kordofan and the western region of Darfur.   This project did reach the implementation phase, but it is unclear whether or when the project was completed.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan issued for the South Kordofan 220kV Power Transmission and Distribution Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis lender expectations. According to Sudan’s Finance Minister Ali Mahmood Abdel-Rasool, China Eximbank suspended its financing for 11 projects in Sudan following the secession of South Sudan in July 2011, which triggered a major loss of oil revenue (a key source of collateral for China Eximbank loans). Ali Mahmood Abdel-Rasool said at the time that the Government of Sudan had previously pledged oil revenues (worth 120,000 barrels per day) to China Eximbank as a source of collateral. Then, on February 18, 2012, the Chinese Government announced that it had agreed to reschedule the outstanding debt obligations of the Government of Sudan by extending loan repayment periods by 5 years (as captured via Project ID#30421). According to the External Debt Unit of the Central Bank of Sudan, the Government of Sudan's total arrears to Chinese creditors amounted to $3.864 billion ($2.608 billion in principal, $1.129 billion in interest, and $127 million in penalty interest) as of March 31, 2022.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient State-owned Company",324505376.040524,"The project involved the construction of an electricity transmission line than runs from the city of El-Obeid (in central Sudan within North Kordofan State) to a power plant in Al-Fulah (or al-Fula or EI Fula or الفولة) in West Kordofan State.

The loan had two tranches: a $425 million tranche (with a 10-year maturity) from Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) and an $875 million tranche (with a 7-year maturity and an interest rate of LIBOR plus 120 basis points) supported by Mizuho Bank, Export Development Canada, Scotiabank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC), the Chile Branch of Bank of China, and the Grand Cayman Branch of Bank of China. The Los Pelambres copper mine in Coquimbo region of Chile is currently being expanded in two phases. The mine has been operating since 2000 and currently produces copper concentrates containing gold and silver and a separate molybdenum concentrate. The $1.8bn expansion project, approved in November 2018, is expected to add an average of 60,000t of copper a year to the mine’s production over the first 15 years of operation. Environment impact assessment (EIA) for the expansion project was approved in February 2018.   Construction is expected to start in early-2019, while production from the first phase is anticipated to start in the second half of 2021. Copper production from the second phase is anticipated to start in 2022. Minera Los Pelambres, a contractual mining company owned and managed by Antofagasta Minerals, is the project developer. Antofagasta holds 60% interest in the project through Antofagasta Minerals, while the remaining stake is held by a Japanese consortium comprising JX Nippon and Mitsubishi Materials, Marubeni, Mitsubishi Corp, and Mitsui & Co.   Los Pelambres is located approximately 45km east from the city of Salamanca and 200km north of Santiago, Coquimbo, Chile. The two-phased expansion project will include the addition of a new semi-autogenous (SAG) mill, ball mill, and corresponding flotation circuit with 24 additional cells. The first phase, referred to as complementary infrastructure project (INCO), is focused on optimizing the production and eliminating the risks arising from the current operating and environmental permits. A new grinding line and a new flotation line will be installed at the existing Piuquenes plant to increase the ore processing capacity from 175,000 tpd to 190,000 tpd. The new additions are expected to increase the company’s fine copper production by 60,000 tpa from the second half of 2021. A reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plant, with a processing capacity of up to 400 liters per second of industrial water, is also proposed to be constructed adjacent to the Punta Chungo port in Los Vilos. The desalinated water will be transported to the existing water recirculation facilities near the El Mauro tailings dam through a 61km-long buried pipeline. The first phase is estimated to involve a capital expenditure of approximately $1.3 billion, of which $600m is allocated for strengthening the milling and flotation. The remaining amount is allocated for the desalination plant and the water impulsion system. The second phase of expansion is expected to increase copper production from the mine by 35,000t a year. A new environmental impact assessment (EIA) will also be undertaken to increase the capacity of El Mauro tailings storage facility and create new mine waste dumps. Estimated to cost approximately $500m, the second phase will include additional mining equipment for increasing the crushing and grinding capacity, and flotation cells.   Ferrocarril de Antofagasta a Bolivia (FCAB) is providing rail and truck services at the copper mine, while Antofagasta Terminal Internacional (ATI) is responsible for the port operations. HighService Engineering and Construction (HSIC) is conducting industrial assembly work, mainly mechanics and structure, at the project.

Then, on June 11, 2013, the Ethiopian House of Representatives ratified the PBC agreement under proclamation no. 795/2013. The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 20 year maturity, an 8 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The Government of Ethiopia's Ministry of Finance and Economic Development subsequently signed an on-lending agreement with Ethiopian Electric Power Corporation (EEPCO). The ultimate borrower (EEPCO) was expected to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance approximately 85% of the total cost of a $340 million commercial (EPC) contract between EEPCO and Hydrochina-CGCOC JV, which was signed on October 11, 2012.   According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $293,250,000 (ETB 5,420,517,560) loan (PBC) achieved a 123% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 10 loan disbursements (worth ETB 6,659,539,738) between 2013 and 2016: an ETB 1,306,818,182 disbursement on October 8, 2013, an ETB 517,241,379 disbursement on January 8, 2014, an ETB 1,712,598,425 disbursement on July 8, 2014, an ETB 343,434,343 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 142,992,012 disbursement on April 8, 2015, an ETB 184,297,042 disbursement on July 8, 2015, an ETB 445,179,744 disbursement on October 7, 2015, an ETB 741,377,956 disbursement on July 7, 2016, an ETB 524,222,698 disbursement on January 7, 2016, and an ETB 741,377,956 disbursement on October 7, 2016. The purpose of the project was to install a 153MW wind farm with 102 turbines near the city of Adama in a range of rocky hills in the Ethiopian highlands 100 kilometers southeast of the capital Addis Ababa. The project also involved the construction of 10 km worth of electricity transmission lines to connect the wind farm to the 230kv grid via the Koka substation.   Hydrochina-CGCOC JV — a joint venture between Hydrochina Corporation, and CGC Overseas Construction Co. Ltd. (CGCOC) — was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Upon completion, it was expected that the Adama II Wind Farm would be able to generate about 476 million kWh electricity every year, thereby meeting over 20% of the electricity needs of the capital city of Ethiopia.  It was also expected that by substituting oil power plants of the same scale, the Adama I Wind Farm and Adama II Wind Farm could together save 160,000 tons of fuel oil and reduce almost 600,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions. Hydrochina Corporation was responsible for the project’s feasibility study. CGCOC was responsible for the project’s mechanical work. Sany Heavy Industry Co., Ltd. — another Chinese company — was responsible for the provision of the wind turbines. Construction started in June 2013. During the construction phase, in order to avoid dust and sand, water was sprayed on the excavated earth.  In order to minimize the impact of traffic noise and dust brought by vehicle transportation during construction, Hydrochina-CGCOC JV strictly controlled and managed the driving times and routes. Speed bumps were set up on a windy road to reduce dust blown by fast-driving vehicles. Trees, flowers and plants were grown around the booster stations. Hydrochina-CGCOC JV also built stone drainage and afforested slopes near the assembly site of wind turbines, thereby preventing soil erosion. Local floral and fauna species were reportedly protected. An official inauguration ceremony for the Adama Wind Farm II (Adama II Wind Farm) took place on May 18, 2015. The wind farm was then transferred to the project owner (EEPCO) and put into operation in June 2016. The 153MW Adama Wind Farm II Project reportedly created thousands of jobs for local people during the construction phase and continued to provide hundreds of jobs for local people during the operation phase.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Adama Wind Farm II Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs.

The estimated borrowing terms of the PBC are follows: a 0% interest rate, no grace period, and a 19.9-year maturity. The borrower was to use the loan proceeds to finance approximately 85% of the cost of an EPC (commercial) contract, which it signed with Shandong Electric Power Construction Corporation III (SEPCOIII, SEPCO3, or 山东电力建设第三工程公司) on July 25, 2013 (following an international call for tenders). The specified duration of the EPC contract was 36 months, beginning on December 31, 2014 and ending on December 30, 2017.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 318-megawatt coal-fired plant in ""Hassi Blal"" near the city of Jerada. The location of the plant is close to the country’s border with Algeria and approximately 60 km south of the city of Oujda (in eastern Morocco). The plant was to be built on the same site as an existing 165MW Jerada power plant, thereby increasing total on-site power generation capacity to approximately 483 MW. The existing plant was made up of three 55MW units operating on pulverized coal. Coal transport from the port of Nador was provided by train and truck. The new plant was also designed to operate on pulverized coal and the electricity that it produced was to be evacuated to the Bourdim substation via two new 400 kV transmission lines. Emergency power was to be provided by a new 60 kV transmission line. The two 400 kV lines and the 60 kV line were to be built by ONEE.  A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on November 19, 2014. However, construction began on October 3, 2014. The power plant started generating electricity on September 19, 2017 and it was put into commercial operation ahead of schedule on December 18, 2017.

On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a ‘pre-emptive’ sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. Its decision to suspend external debt service reportedly affected all China Development Bank loans with amounts outstanding at the time of the announcement. By March 2023, the Government of Sri Lanka had accumulated $338 million in arrears to China Development Bank.  PRP3 Phase I was divided into two parts, A and B.

This loan carried the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 6 month LIBOR plus a 4% margin, a 2% default (penalty) interest rate, a 15 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 0.8% commitment fee, and a 1% management fee. The Government of Honduras provided a sovereign guarantee for the loan on December 27, 2013.   The first ICBC loan disbursement (of $48 million) took place on August 10, 2015. As of November 2016, the loan had achieved an 89.8% disbursement rate ($267.4 million out of $297.7 million). The borrower (ENEE) made no principal payment and an interest payment worth $15.86 million in 2018. Then, in 2019, the borrower made a principal payment worth $14.76 million and an interest payment worth $17.21 million. The loan's (principal) amount outstanding was $266.41 million as of December 31, 2018 and $258.91 million as of December 31, 2019.  The purpose of the Patuca III project was to construct a hydroelectric dam in Patuca on the Rio Patuca in Olancho located in the south-eastern part of Honduras. The project involved the construction of a dam with a height of 57 meters, a shot and a pressure pipe creating a fall of 42.2 meters and a reservoir area of 51 square kilometers. At the end of the pipe is a surface house where two Kaplan turbines were to be installed. Construction of the project was expected to reduce dependence on expensive thermal energy and further diversify the country’s energy matrix. Upon completion, the project was expected have an estimated capacity of 104MW and is expected to generate 326 GWh per year. It was estimated that the completed project will serve a population of nearly one million people.   The project was completed in several stages. The first phase, which was completed in 2013, involved the design and construction of the cofferdam, diversion tunnel, bridge access, land acquisition and other complementary works at a cost of approximately $153.0 million. The second phase was executed at an estimated cost of $554.4 million. It consisted of the acquisition of generators, purchase and installation of two turbines, construction of the transmission line, installation of transformers, construction of the curtain and the reservoir, construction of the machine house, access roads, among others activities. The second phase was financed with funds from ENEE ($205.6 million), as well as loans to the Central Government from Bancatlan ($14.8 million), Petrocaribe ($36.1 million) and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China ($297.7 million).   The contractor responsible for project implementation is Sinohydro. Project implementation officially commenced on September 21, 2015. The Patuca III dam was officially inaugurated in January 2021. The project was originally scheduled to reach completion in the spring of 2018. However, the project faced implementation delays due the the fact that ENEE had trouble raising $35 million of additional funding to address a set of resettlement and environmental protections concerns before the dam could become operational.  A 2008 Honduran Government-sponsored environmental impact assessment (EIA) was 'so weak,' according to a 2012 letter from the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) to the Honduran Government, 'that we could not even envision starting to study [Tegucigalpa's request for project funding] seriously.' Among the failings the IADB’s EIA identified, the Honduran Government neither adequately consulted with nor compensated affected communities. According to the IADB, changes in the Patuca river’s flow also threatened several species of migrating fish, as well as lizards, crocodiles and turtles.  When the IADB declined to fund the 104MW Patuca III Dam Project, ICBC stepped in as an alternative source of financing.   The Patuca III Dam Project was plagued by accusations of corruption. The Honduran National Anti-Corruption Council investigated several officials at ENEE for the alleged embezzlement of more than $4 million from the construction of the barracks that housed Sinohydro’s technicians and laborers.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Commercial Bank","Recipient State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company",335838967.980348,"The Patuca III hydroelectric dam is located in Patuca on the Rio Patuca in Olancho located in the south-eastern part of Honduras.

By September 2020, the project design process was complete and implementation was expected to start by the end of 2020. As of December 2020, all of the necessary materials and equipment were on-site to begin construction but project implementation had stalled due to the fact that the Congolese Government had not met its counterpart funding commitment. China Eximbank was also withholding loan disbursements. In August 2021, Alphonse Shungu, the Director General of the RVA, reported that the project had only achieved a 9.21% completion rate.   Then, in 2021 and 2021, Qatar Airways Group (QAG) reportedly prepared a major contract for the renovation and management of three strategic airports in the DRC: N'djili International Airport, Ndolo Airport and Lubumbashi Airport. The feasibility studies were entrusted to the Dutch company NACO, which specializes in airport infrastructure. The two parties, who signed a memorandum of understanding in March 2021, agreed on a public-private partnership (PPP) under which QAG would shoulder the cost of renovating and updating the three airports on its own, in exchange for managing it for an unspecified length of time (perhaps as long as thirty years). Under these terms, RVA would no longer manage these airports, depriving it of the bulk of its revenues, especially of the highly controversial ‘go-pass’ tax that travelers have to pay.   Also, as of September 2022, the Congolese Government was reportedly looking to end its partnership with Weihai International Economic & Technical Cooperative (WIETC) for the construction of the new N'djili airport.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Recipient Government Agency|Chinese State-owned Company",338303057.622905,"The purpose of this project was to approve a loan for the N’djili and Luano Airport Terminals Project.

KCP, which is jointly owned by KTO (50% equity stake) and CNODC (50% equity stake), was created to construct and operate the Atasu-Alashankou Pipeline and the Kenkiyak-Kumkol Pipeline. These pipelines are two of three pipeline systems of the Kazakhstan-China Pipeline network, which was built to create a transport corridor for the export of Kazakhstani oil to China. To finance the 965 km Atasu-Alashankou pipeline, CNODC and KTO contributed $50 million of their own funds (as captured by linked project ID#39605). In addition, $600 million was raised through the issuing of Eurobonds by JP Morgan Bank.

Then, on June 15, 2014, Chinese Vice President Li Yuanchao and Zambian Vice President Guy Scott witnessed the signing of two Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreements (ETCA). One committed a $32 million grant (captured via Project ID#40890) and the other committed $32 million interest-free loan (captured via Project ID#40889). Some of the funds from one or both of these ETCAs helped finance the KKIA Airport Expansion Project.  Then, on September 16, 2014, China Eximbank and the Government of Zambia’s Ministry of Finance and National Planning signed two loan agreements for the Kenneth Kaunda International Airport (KKIA) Airport Expansion Project: a $306,000,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) and a $54,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement. The PBC, captured via Project ID#40893, carried the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee.

The proceeds of the GCL and the PBC were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $385,000,000 (or $385,809,673) commercial contract between the Government of Zambia and China Jiangxi Corporation for International Economic and Cooperation, which was signed on June 3, 2013 and amended on September 5, 2013. As of July 2022, the PBC had achieved a 74.7% disbursement rate ($228,810,000 out of $306,000,000).  The project involves the expansion of Kenneth Kaunda International Airport in Lusaka (exact locational coordinates: -15.325266732091906, 28.448490127571315). More specifically, the project involves the construction of a new presidential pavilion, passenger terminal, commercial complex, airport shopping mall, office park, warehousing facilities, fire station, control tower, and hotel. It also included the rehabilitation of the existing terminal into a new one to carter for domestic flights.  China Jiangxi Corporation for International Economic and Technical Cooperation is the contractor responsible for design and works. The contract with Zambia Airports Corporation Ltd. (ZACL) came into force on March 10, 2015 and construction began on April 1, 2015.   The project was originally expected to commenced on April 21, 2015 and conclude on October 20, 2019. The expected project completion date was later revised to June 2020 and then March 10, 2022. As of July 31, 2020, the project had achieved an 89% completion rate. As of April 30, 2021, the project had achieved a 93% completion rate. As of June 30, 2021, $271,900,000 had been paid to CJIC (representing 75.53% of the EPC contract value). As of August 31, 2021, the new airport terminal building had been handed over and commissioned, but, the following works were outstanding: bullet-proofing and finishing on the presidential pavilion (89% completion rate); steel structure installation on the corridor connecting the terminals (35% completion rate); a widening of the taxiway shoulder (98% completion rate); a rehabilitation of the existing terminal building (5% completion rate); and a rehabilitation of ZASTI (10% completion rate). A formal airport opening ceremony took place on August 9, 2021.   This project has been plagued by corruption allegations and performance problems. In April 2015, media outlets reported that Zambian government officials and CJIC stole $25 million from the China Eximbank loan by unilaterally changing the original contract from $385 million to $360 million. This corruption allegation and contract renegotiations delayed project implementation by a few years. Then, in October 2019, China Eximbank reportedly halted loan disbursements due to concerns that the Government of Zambia would default on its repayment obligations.  On July 29, 2022, the Ministry of Finance & National Planning (MOFNP) of Zambia announced that it was seeking lender approval to formally cancel the PBC’s undisbursed balance ($77,190,000.00); however, it also noted that it had not yet secured formal lender approval for this action. This announcement came approximately 21 months after the Government of Zambia defaulted on its repayment obligations to Eurobond holders and approximately 6 weeks after China, France, and 14 other countries formed a creditor committee to discuss the Zambian authorities’ request for a debt treatment under ‘the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the DSSI’ endorsed by the G20 and the Paris Club. MOFNP also announced on July 29, 2022 that it planned to finance the completion of the Kenneth Kaunda International Airport (KKIA) Airport Expansion Project with general government revenues, and it signaled its intention to rescope the project to focus on the construction of the old terminal building and the extension of the runway and lighting system.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient State-owned Company",338771140.810997,"Kenneth Kaunda International Airport (KKIA) is located in Lusaka.

The Hungary-Serbia Railway will run from Budapest, the capital of Hungary, to Belgrade, the capital of Serbia, for a total length of 350 kilometers, including 166 kilometers in Hungary and 184 kilometers in Serbia. The railway was an electrified passenger and freight mixed-line express railway. The total cost of the project of the project was estimated to be EUR 1-1.5 billion.    The Serbian section was divided into three sections. The first section, Belgrade-Stara Pazova, was 34.5 kilometers long, the second section from Stara Pazova to Novi Sad was 40.5 kilometers long, and the third section from Novi Sad to Subotica was 108.1 kilometers long. The first section and second sections of the railway were constructed by the consortium formed by China Communications Construction and China Railway International, while the second section of the railway fell under the responsibility of Russia's subsidiary Russian Railways International.   Then, on November 5, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of the Republic of Serbia signed a Memorandum of Understanding on financing the Project of Modernization and Reconstruction of Hungarian-Serbian Railway Line on the Territory of the Republic of Serbia.  Then, on May 16, 2017, China Eximbank and the Government of the Republic of Serbia’s Ministry of Finance signed a preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK NO.  PBC (2017) 9 (435)] worth $297,638,159 for the Belgrade-Stara Pazova Section of the Hungarian-Serbian Railway Project. The loan (PBC) carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee.    The proceeds of the loan (PBC) were used to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the $350,162,540 value of the commercial contract [number 351-5684/2016-2] between the Government of the Republic of Serbia’s Ministry of Construction, Transport and Infrastructure, the Joint Stock Company for Public Railway Infrastructure Management “Infrastructure of Serbian Railways”, and a joint venture of China Railway International Co. Ltd & China Communications Construction Company Ltd, which was signed on November 5, 2016.    The lender made disbursements worth $59,528,000 in 2018, $37,648,000 in 2019, $34,304,000 in 2020, and $96,724,000 in 2021. The loan’s (principal) amount outstanding was $59,528,000 as of December 31, 2018, $97,176,000 as of December 31, 2019, $131,480,000 as of December 31, 2020, $228,204,000 as of December 31, 2021, and $294,224,000 as of September 31, 2022.   This project involves the reconstruction and modernization of a 34.5 km double-track section of the Hungarian-Serbian Railway that runs from the capital city of Belgrade to Stara Pazova. It was designed to accommodate speeds of up to 200 km per hour and to reduce the travel time between the Serbian and Hungarian capitals from eight hours to less than three hours. It was also designed in accordance with EU standards.  The agreement for the Serbian section of the rail line stipulated that only 46% of the contract may go to local Serbian companies. Zorana Mihajlović, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Construction, Transport and Infrastructure of Serbia, said that the first section of the Hungarian-Serbian Railway in Serbia was expected to begin construction in November 2017. China Railway International Co. Ltd and China Communications Construction Company Ltd were the EPC contractors responsible for implementation. Project implementation commenced on November 28, 2017.    The left line of the Belgrade-Zemun section of the Hungary-Serbia Railway was opened successfully on October 21, 2020. The Belgrade-Stara Pazova Section of the Belgrade-Budapest Railway was successfully put into operation on March 19, 2022.

Ltd. (CPHGC) signed a $1,496,000,000 syndicated loan agreement with a consortium of Chinese state-owned banks — including China Development Bank (CDB, lead arranger), the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank, co-lead arranger), the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), China Construction Bank Corporation (CCB), and Bank of Communications Co. Limited (BOCOM) — for the 2×660MW Imported Coal Based Independent Power Generation Project at Hub. According to CPHGC's upfront tariff application to Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority, the estimated borrowing terms of the syndicated loan are as follows: a maturity period of 14 years, a grace period of 4 years, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 450 basis points (4.5%). The borrower purchased buyer's credit insurance from Sinosure. As sources of collateral, the borrower also pledged shareholdings, assets, accounts, electricity payment receivables, and its Sinosure insurance policy.

CCB's contribution is captured via Project ID#92390. BOCOM's contribution is captured via Project ID#92391.   The total cost of this independent power project (IPP) was $1.995 billion and it was financed according to a 75:25 debt-to-equity ratio. CPHGC is a project company and joint venture of China Power International Holding Ltd (CPIH) and the Hub Power Company Limited (HUBCO) that was established to finance, design, and implement this 1320 MW imported coal based power project. CPIH has a 74% ownership stake and HUBCO has a 26% ownership stake in CPHGC. CPHGC was granted a generation license by Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) on September 8, 2016. The term of the license is 30 years from the date of the commencement of commercial operations. CPHGC also submitted an application for an upfront tariff determination with NEPRA, which was approved on February 12, 2016. Then, on January 25, 2017, the Implementation Agreement (IA) and Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) were signed.   The purpose of the project is to construct 2×660 MW coal fired units and a dedicated jetty terminal to import coal at Hub, Mouza Kund, Tehsil Gadani, Lasbela District, and Balochistan Province. Northwest Electric Power Design Institute Co. Ltd. (NWEPDI) and Tianjin Electric Power Construction Company Limited are the EPC contractors responsible for project design and implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on March 21, 2017, and on April 10, 2018, CPHGC entered into Operation and Maintenance (O&M) contract with a consortium that consists of CEEC Tianjin (Pakistan) Electric Power Construction (Private) Limited, China Energy Engineering Group, Tianjin Electric Power Construction Company Limited, and China Energy Engineering Group Science and Technology Development Company Limited to provide operation and maintenance service for the coal-fired electric power generation plant. The project reached its commercial operation date (COD) on August 17, 2019. Its originally expected commercial operation date was August 31, 2018. It is expected that this power plant will provide 9 billion kWh electricity to Pakistan’s national grid each year, thereby meeting the electricity needs of 4 million Pakistani households.   However, this project has encountered a number of revenue generation, debt repayment, and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. The Government of Pakistan fell behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to CPHGC. Total payment arrears, as of May 2022, amounted to PKR 71.6 billion (approximately $379,480,000), which reportedly brought the power plant to the brink of closure and CPHGC to the brink of default. It also became more difficult for CPHGC to source the coal needed to power the plant (due to the inability of a supplier to provide coal from Afghanistan and skyrocketing international coal prices). Then, in July 2022, CPHGC) revealed that the country’s central bank — the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) — had stopped making various payments relating to coal suppliers due to the limited availability of foreign exchange in the country, which resulted in a major accumulation of payment arrears. In a letter dated July 20, 2022, the CEO of CPHGC, Ren Lihui, wrote to Pakistan’s Secretary of Power and warned that ‘any further delay in […] payments [from the State Bank of Pakistan] can adversely affect the ability of CPHGC to operate smoothly.’ He also warned that ‘If the Government of Pakistan fails to fulfill its responsibilities or does not respond in a timely manner, any loss, damages or [liquidated damages] should be borne by the Government of Pakistan.’   Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this “[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country’s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).

CPHGC is a project company and joint venture of China Power International Holding Ltd (CPIH) and the Hub Power Company Limited (HUBCO) that was established to finance, design, and implement this 1320 MW imported coal based power project. CPIH has a 74% ownership stake and HUBCO has a 26% ownership stake in CPHGC. CPHGC was granted a generation license by Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) on September 8, 2016. The term of the license is 30 years from the date of the commencement of commercial operations. CPHGC also submitted an application for an upfront tariff determination with NEPRA, which was approved on February 12, 2016. Then, on January 25, 2017, the Implementation Agreement (IA) and Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) were signed.   The purpose of the project is to construct 2×660 MW coal fired units and a dedicated jetty terminal to import coal at Hub, Mouza Kund, Tehsil Gadani, Lasbela District, and Balochistan Province. Northwest Electric Power Design Institute Co. Ltd. (NWEPDI) and Tianjin Electric Power Construction Company Limited are the EPC contractors responsible for project design and implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on March 21, 2017, and on April 10, 2018, CPHGC entered into Operation and Maintenance (O&M) contract with a consortium that consists of CEEC Tianjin (Pakistan) Electric Power Construction (Private) Limited, China Energy Engineering Group, Tianjin Electric Power Construction Company Limited, and China Energy Engineering Group Science and Technology Development Company Limited to provide operation and maintenance service for the coal-fired electric power generation plant. The project reached its commercial operation date (COD) on August 17, 2019. Its originally expected commercial operation date was August 31, 2018. It is expected that this power plant will provide 9 billion kWh electricity to Pakistan’s national grid each year, thereby meeting the electricity needs of 4 million Pakistani households.   However, this project has encountered a number of revenue generation, debt repayment, and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. The Government of Pakistan fell behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to CPHGC. Total payment arrears, as of May 2022, amounted to PKR 71.6 billion (approximately $379,480,000), which reportedly brought the power plant to the brink of closure and CPHGC to the brink of default. It also became more difficult for CPHGC to source the coal needed to power the plant (due to the inability of a supplier to provide coal from Afghanistan and skyrocketing international coal prices). Then, in July 2022, CPHGC) revealed that the country’s central bank — the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) — had stopped making various payments relating to coal suppliers due to the limited availability of foreign exchange in the country, which resulted in a major accumulation of payment arrears. In a letter dated July 20, 2022, the CEO of CPHGC, Ren Lihui, wrote to Pakistan’s Secretary of Power and warned that ‘any further delay in […] payments [from the State Bank of Pakistan] can adversely affect the ability of CPHGC to operate smoothly.’ He also warned that ‘If the Government of Pakistan fails to fulfill its responsibilities or does not respond in a timely manner, any loss, damages or [liquidated damages] should be borne by the Government of Pakistan.’   Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this '[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country’s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).

This PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 1.5% interest rate. Project ID#31066 captures the GCL and Project ID#57336 captures the PBC. The proceeds of the GCL and the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract between Anhui Foreign Economic Construction Group Co., Ltd. (AFECC) and Mozambique's National Roads Administration, which was signed on March 27, 2012.   The $416.5 million project involved the upgrading and rehabilitation of an 288 km road from Beira to Machipanda and a bridge that was constructed over the River Pungue. The completion of the project was expected to shorten the journey from the western border of Mozambique to the port of Beira from 7 hours to 4 hours, thereby facilitating regional connectivity, stimulating the development of agriculture, tourism and other industries along the route, and promoting exports.   AFECC was the contractor responsible for implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony was held on July 10, 2014. However, construction did not begin until April 1, 2015. The project was originally scheduled for completion on March 31, 2018. However, it was ultimately completed and National Highway No. 6 was opened to traffic on November 14, 2019. The collection of tolls commenced on January 1, 2020.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Beira-Machipanda (N6) Road Rehabilitation Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2016, several credit rating agencies downgraded the Government of Mozambique to 'selective default' or 'restricted default' status, and the World Bank and the IMF re-classified Mozambique's external debt as 'in distress.' In January 2017, the Government of Mozambique defaulted on a coupon payment for its dollar-denominated Eurobond. Then, in February 2018, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) announced that the Government of Mozambique had accumulated $710 million in arrears to external creditors and had agreed to reschedule some bilateral debt service payments with the Chinese Government. Two months later, in April 2018, Stelia Neta, a National Director at the Ministry of Finance of Mozambique revealed that the Government of Mozambique’s outstanding debt obligations to the Chinese Government amounted to $2.02 billion and the Chinese Government had agreed to extend the grace periods (and first principal repayments) on these outstanding debt obligations without changing their final maturity dates or interest rates (as captured via Project ID#66283).","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese Private Sector",345856550.292011,"This project involved the upgrading and rehabilitation of an 288 km road (N6) from Beira to Machipanda and a bridge that was constructed over the River Pungue.

Then, on November 14, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh signed an RMB 1,950,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement and a $405.8 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the Multi-Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project. The GCL carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a grace period of 5 years, and a 0.2% commitment fee. The PBC carries the following terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a grace period of 5 years, and a 0.2% commitment fee. Project ID#55046 captures the GCL, while Project ID#38342 captures the PBC. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the GCL and the PBC to finance a commercial contract between the Government of Bangladesh’s Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges and China Communication Construction Company (CCCC), which was signed in June 2015. The GCL had disbursed RMB 936,1890,000 as of June 30, 2018, RMB 1,557,869,000 as of June 30, 2019, RMB 1,950,000,000 as of June 30, 2020, and RMB 1,950,000,000 as of June 30, 2021. No repayments on the GCL had been made as of June 30, 2019 or June 30, 2021. As of June 30, 2021, the PBC had disbursed $165.559 million and no repayments had been made.   The purpose of the project, which is also known as the Multilane Karnaphuli Tunnel Project, is to construct a 3.4-kilometer-long, 10-meter-wide tunnel under the Karnaphuli River near the Port of Chittagong. The total length of the proposed tunnel will be around 9.092 kilometers, including a 3.40-kilometer tunnel under the Karnaphuli River with an approach road of 4.89 kilometers alongside 740 meters of bridges linking the main port city, and western side of the Karnaphuli along with the eastern side of the river. Upon completion, the tunnel will connect the port of Chittagong to the industrial area of the city and thereby relieve pressure on the three existing bridges. The total area of the project is 382.03 acres. More than 360.64 acres of land were acquired for the construction of roads and installments of utility lines. A total of 2,275 families are affected by this project, and 1,660 were given compensation. China Communication Construction Company (CCCC) is the general (EPC) contractor responsible for project implementation.   On November 24, 2015, the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) approved the Multi-Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project. Construction began on February 24, 2017.    Two years later, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh officially inaugurated boring works on the tunnel on February 24, 2019. The project had achieved a 40% physical completion rate by May 2019, including the installation of over 150 meters of the first tunnel and much of the above-ground works. Then, on July 31, 2020, the project reached a key milestone with the completion of the first underwater, after a made-in-China super-diameter slurry-pressure-balance tunnel boring machine (TBM) broke through at the Karnaphuli River east bank working shaft.    The TBM, which is 94 meters long and weighs more than 2,200 tons, was developed by the Tianhe Mechanical Equipment Manufacturing Co. It was the first super-diameter slurry-pressure-balance TBM to be self-developed and exported by China. The TBM uses several self-developed technologies, such as an automatic mud water circulation system. As of October 2021, all boring-related work was completed — after the excavation of the second tube (from Anwara end of Chittagong to Patenga end) of the 3.315-km tunnel) — and the project had achieved a 73% physical completion rate. By November 2021, the project had achieved a 77.5% physical completion rate. On May 8, 2022, Harunur Rashid Chowdhury, Project Director of Karnaphuli Multilane Road Tunnel, sent a letter to the Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA). In it, he noted that Shanghai Port had remained closed since March 2022 due to Covid-19 and the Chinese Government’s zero-tolerance policy had affected the project’s progress: ‘It may be noted that […] most of the goods and equipment are being manufactured/procured from Shanghai. Therefore, the closure of the Shanghai Port is causing a delay in shipments. […] The goods and equipment planned to arrive in March [2022] are still not able to reach Chittagong Port to date. Subsequent shipments will also get affected on this account.’ In the letter, Harunur Rashid Chowdhury also asked the BBA to take up the issue with the Economic Relations Division (ERD) and arrange an extension of the China Eximbank loan availability period by six months until May 6, 2023. On May 7, 2022, Li Zheng, the CCCC Project Manager of the Karnaphuli Tunnel Project Site Office, acknowledged in a letter to Harunur Rashid Chowdhury that the delay in shipments from Shanghai was the result of China’s ‘zero Covid’ measures. Then, in June 2022, BBA announced that two sub-contractors hired CCCC to complete two project components — a management software system for BBA and the service area (east) — had violated their contractual obligations. According to a letter from Harunur Rashid Chowdhury, Project Director of Karnaphuli Multilane Road Tunnel, to the BBA, ‘CCCC was instructed to undertake this work, but they employed sub-contractors to do so.  CCCC selected these sub-contractors and is responsible for any default of the sub-contractors. […] Unfortunately, CCCC has not effectively monitored or exercised control over both these sub-contractors.’ The Multi-Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project was originally expected to reach completion by the end of 2020. However, in 2018, the project’s expected completion date was pushed back to December 4, 2022.    Upon completion, the underwater tunnel is expected to reduce the time it takes to drive from Hittagong Shah Amanat International Airport to the Hittagong industrial park from four hours to 20 minutes.","Implementation","Development","Loan","ODA-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company",346507983.33725,"The Karnaphuli River Tunnel is located near the port of Chittagong.

The purpose of the project was to develop and launch the ‘Túpac Katari’ communications satellite. The satellite, which owes its name to an Aymara warrior and activist who fought the Spanish for indigenous independence in the 18th century, weighs 5.3 tons, 2.36 meters long and 2.1 meters wide. Its useful life is 15 years. It consists of 30 channels and operates on three frequencies. The first frequency is used to cover a large part of the Bolivian territory in internet services, the second frequency covers radio and communication broadcasts and the third frequency is planned to rent different types of transmissions to neighboring countries. The main customer of the Túpac Katari satellite services is the state-owned National Telecommunications Company (Entel), and the Government of Bolivia expected that the satellite would generate annual revenues of nearly $40 million for the provision of services to local and international firms.   CGWIC was the contractor responsible for project implementation, which commenced in August 2011. Bolivia's first communications satellite, Tupac Katari (TKSAT-1), was officially launched on December 20, 2013 from the Xinchang satellite launch center. It was launched by the LM-3B/E launch vehicle developed by China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT), and China Satellite Launch & Tracking Control General (CLTC) was responsible for the ground segment. On April 1, 2014, the satellite began commercial operations. The Túpac Katari satellite project was reportedly so successful that the Government of Bolivia decided that it wanted to build two more.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","COMMUNICATIONS","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Recipient Government Agency|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Government Agency",347539686.831658,"The project involved the construction and launch of the TKSAT-1 satellite itself, as well as two satellite ground measurement and control stations and technical training for those ground stations.

The loan (PBC) carries the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 3%, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 5 year grace period, a 20 year maturity, a 0.75% commitment fee, and a 1% management fee. Then, on May 28, 2012, the Government of the Republic of Serbia and Elektroprivreda Srbije (EPS) — a Serbian state-owned power company — signed an on-lending agreement [No. 48-2527/2012-1] for Phase 1 of the Kostolac B Power Plant Project.

The PBC carries the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. It is backed by a sovereign repayment guarantee from Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance. An initial loan disbursement of $79.8 million took place on October 31, 2014, leaving a balance of $239.7 million to be disbursed in multiple tranches between 2015 and 2017. The loan’s amount outstanding was $214,554,588 as of December 31, 2016 and $273,700,750 as of December 31, 2017. Its amount outstanding (including principal, interest, and arrears) was $305,331,749.40 as of September 2021.   Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance used the proceeds from the PBC to on-lend to Kariba Hydro Power Company (Private) Limited (KHPC), which is a special purpose vehicle (project company) that is wholly owned by Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC). KHPC entered into power purchase agreements (PPAs) with Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC) and Nampower. It planned to service the China Eximbank PBC with revenue derived from power sales to ZETDC and Nampower. The lender required the borrower to maintain a minimum cash balance of $32 million in multiple, lender-controlled escrow accounts: $26 million in a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) and $6 million in a Maintenance Reserve Account (MRA). ZPC also agreed to make a $35 million equity contribution to support the project’s implementation.    This project involved an expansion of the existing 750MW Kariba South hydropower station. The purpose of the expansion was to increase the installed capacity of the Kariba South hydropower station through the addition of two additional units of 150MW each, resulting in an aggregate 1,050MW installed capacity. The Kariba dam is situated in the Zambezi river basin between Zambia and Zimbabwe. There are two hydropower stations at the dam: the Kariba North hydropower station, which is owned by Zambia, and the Kariba South hydropower station, which is owned by Zimbabwe. Kariba South was commissioned in 1962, and it generates electricity from water drawn from Lake Kariba, forcing it through a short intake and vertical penstock to a turbine where hydroelectric power is produced in the coupled generator. The water is then discharged downstream back into the Zambezi river. Sinohydro Bureau 16 Co., LTD was the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor responsible for implementation of the Kariba South Hydro Project. A groundbreaking ceremony for this project took place on September 4, 2014, and a project completion ceremony was held on March 28, 2018. During the construction process, Sinohydro Bureau 16 Co., LTD reportedly hired and trained local employees and brought more than 3,000 job opportunities to Zimbabwe.    However, the power plant encountered operational challenges after it was constructed and the borrowing institution (KHPC) has breached its contractual obligations with China Eximbank. In a 2016 Report on Parastatals and State Enterprises, Zimbabwe’s Accountant and Auditor General noted that KHPC and ZPC were in breach of contract for not depositing the cash proceeds from the power purchase agreement into a China Eximbank-controlled escrow account. The report concluded that ‘[c]ontrary to the terms set out in the escrow agreement, ZPC power purchase agreement proceeds have not been paid into the said account by ZPC. ZPC confirmed a netted inter-company balance implying that the power proceeds payable to KHPC are being set-off against inter-company receivables from KHPC.’ Then, on November 25, 2022, Munyaradzi Munodawafa, the Chief Executive Office Zambezi River Authority — an entity responsible for the Kariba Dam that is jointly owned by Zimbabwe and neighboring Zambia — sent a letter to Zimbabwe Power Company, which noted that water levels at the Kariba South hydroelectric power facility were at record low levels and electricity generation activities could no longer continue. The letter also noted that the Kariba South hydroelectric power facility had used more than its 2022 water allocation and that the Kariba Dam’s usable storage was only 4.6 percent full.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company",360357955.701468,"The Kariba dam is located in the Kariba Gorge of the Zambezi river basin between Zambia and Zimbabwe.

This framework agreement (captured in Project ID#60219) was ratified on October 26, 2006.   One of the subsidiary loans that was approved through the framework agreement was a $328.1 million loan in 2014 for the Mpila Twin Towers Construction Project.

Then, on November 5, 2004, China Eximbank and the Government of Indonesia signed a $160.2 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement (#BLA04082) for the Surabaya-Madura Island Bridge Construction Project. The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a maturity of 15 years, a grace period of 7 years, and an interest rate of 3%. The proceeds from the PBC were to be used by the borrower to partially finance an EPC contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), which was signed on September 24, 2004.   Then, on November 5, 2005, China Eximbank provided an additional $68.9 million to the Government of Indonesia for the Surabaya-Madura Island Bridge Construction Project through an amendment to the PBC agreement that became effective on September 13, 2005 (captured in Project ID#61205). The additional PBC proceeds were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a supplemental commercial (EPC) contract worth $83.453 million between CRBC and the Ministry of Public Works of Indonesia, which was signed on July 9, 2008.   The purpose of the project was to construct the 5.4 kilometer long, 30 meter wide bridge linking the city of Suramadu with Madura Island (exact locational coordinates: 7°11′3″S 112°46′49″E). It is the first bridge to cross the Madura Strait. The cable-stayed portion has three spans with lengths 192 meters (630 ft), 434 meters (1,424 ft), and 192 meters (630 ft). The bridge has two lanes in each direction plus an emergency lane and a dedicated lane for motorcycles in each direction.   CRBC was the general (EPC) contractor responsible for implementation. However, China Harbor Engineering Co. Ltd. and a consortium of Indonesian companies, PT Adhi Karya and PT Waskita Karya, were also involved in implementation (most likely as subcontractors).   Construction began on November 19, 2005. The main span of Suramadu Bridge linking Surabaya in East Java mainland and Madura Island was connected successfully at midnight local time on Tuesday, March 31, 2009. The bridge was officially open to traffic on June 10, 2009. Within a week of the opening, it was discovered that nuts and bolts as well as maintenance lamps had been stolen and that there was evidence of vandalism of cables supporting the main span. As is often the case with public sector infrastructure facilities in Indonesia, there has been pressure to keep the tariffs for use of the bridge low. Tolls were initially set at Rp30,000 (USD $3 in 2009) for four-wheeled vehicles and Rp3,000 (USD $0.30) for two-wheelers. However, in early 2016, it was announced that President Jokowi favored a 50% cut in the tolls to help promote the competitiveness of industries on the Madura side of the bridge. On October 27, 2018, toll tariffs were abolished for all types of vehicles.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient State-owned Company|Recipient State-owned Company",364879869.926239,"The purpose of the project was to construct the 5.4 kilometer long, 30 meter wide bridge linking the city of Suramadu with Madura Island (exact locational coordinates: 7°11′3″S 112°46′49″E).

64776,"China (People's Republic of)","Lao People's Democratic Republic","Asia",2017,2020,"China Eximbank provides $321 million government concessional loan for Banha-Sekong Power Transmission Project","On May 16, 2017, China Eximbank and the Ministry of Finance of Laos signed a $321 million government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Banha-Sekong Power Transmission Project. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance a $321 million commercial (EPC) contract between Électricité du Laos (EDL) — the state corporation of Laos that owns and operates the country's electricity generation, electricity transmission and electricity distribution assets — and China Gezhouba Group Company Limited (CGGC), which was signed on October 13, 2016.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 237-kilometer 500kV high-voltage transmission lines (measuring 237 km in length) and two 230kv substations in Champasak, Attapeu, Saravan, and Sekong provinces. Ultimately, the project sought to connect the power grids in the southern and central regions of Laos, improve the supply and stability of power to the southern region, and increase the export of electricity to earn foreign exchange.   China Energy Construction Guangxi Institute was the contractor responsible for project design. CGGC was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Project implementation commenced on January 12, 2018. On October 7, 2019, the 230 kV Banha Substation which is part of the project, was put into operation. Then, on November 1, 2020, a 18.573 km 500Kv double-circuit transmission line from Banha substation to the Cambodian border was completed.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Banha-Sekong Power Transmission Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. Laos’ gross foreign exchange reserves were dangerously low between 2019 and 2021, hovering between 1.4 and 2.3 months of import cover, and total public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt increased from 68 percent of GDP ($12.5 billion) in 2019 to 88 percent in 2021 of GDP (or $14.5 billion). According to a report published by the World Bank in April 2022, ‘[t]he energy sector, mostly represented by Électricité du Laos (EDL), accounted for over 30 percent of total PPG debt in 2021. […] EDL’s debt service obligations [were] still unsustainable [at the time], with future debt service accounting for about two fifths of EDL’s total operating revenue.’ The Laotian authorities sought and secured debt service payment deferrals from their Chinese creditors in 2020 and 2021; according to the World Bank, ‘[d]ebt service deferrals granted by major lenders in 2020-2021 amounted around 3.6 percent of GDP in 2021’ and ’[a]s a result, actual debt service payments are estimated to have declined to 48 percent of total revenues in 2021, compared to 65 percent in the 2021 [Government of Laos] plan.’  The country’s central bank (Bank of the Lao P.D.R) also made a $300 million drawdown under its currency swap agreement with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in June 2020 — when its gross reserves stood at only 1.5 months of import cover and credit rating agencies warned of a high default probability. Then, in 2021, the short-term emergency loan from the PBOC was ‘rolled over’ for another year. Around the same time, a Chinese state-owned enterprise purchased a major public infrastructure asset in Laos—a large part of the country’s electricity transmission grid—from EDL as part of an apparent debt-for-equity swap. China Southern Power Grid Co. and EDL established a joint venture known as Électricité du Laos Transmission Company Limited (EDLT) in September 2020.  China Southern Power Grid Co. purchased a 90% ownership stake in EDLT in exchange for a $600 million fee (equity infusion). Then, in March 2021, EDLT signed a 25-year concession agreement, which made it responsible for management of the country’s high-voltage transmission network above 230 kilovolts. Independent observers suggested at the time that EDL would likely use the $600 million upfront payment from China Southern Power Grid Co. to service its outstanding debts to Chinese creditors, although this has not been independently confirmed. According to the World Bank’s International Debt Statistics, the Government of Laos was responsible for making average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $232 million between 2019 and 2019 and average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $60 million between 2020 and 2021 (a substantially lower figure due to payment deferrals); however, it expected to make average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth nearly $678 million over the next seven years (2022-2028).","Completion","Development","Loan","ODA-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Government Agency|Recipient State-owned Company",369900548.403732,"The purpose of the project was to construct a 237-kilometer 500kV high-voltage transmission lines (measuring 237 km in length) and two 230kv substations in Champasak, Attapeu, Saravan, and Sekong provinces.

The loan carries a 15-year maturity, a 4-year maturity, and an annual interest rate of 12-month LIBOR plus a 1% margin. It was backed by a Sinosure insurance policy and secured by (i.e. collateralized against) with account pledge agreement, an insurance policy pledge agreement, and a land and building mortgage agreement, among other things. The proceeds of the loan were used to partially finance a commercial (EPC) contract PowerChina's subsidiary, Sinohydro Group, signed with the Cambodian Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy, and Electricite du Cambodge on February 23, 2006.   The total cost of this 44-year Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) project was $280,500,000. 72% of the project cost was covered through China Eximbank debt financing (captured in this project) and 28% of the project cost was covered through equity (captured in Project ID#65326).   The purpose of the project was to construct a 194.1MW hydroelectric power plant (with eight power generation units) in Bokor National Park (BNP), which is an extension of the Cardamom Mountains in the Elephant Mountain Range in southwestern Cambodia on the Kamchay River. The nearest city to the project site is the provincial town of Kampot, which is about 15km downstream of the river and 150km from Phnom Penh. Upon completion, the plant was expected to have a total installed capacity of 193,200 kilowatts. The electricity generated by the plant was to be connected through the Kampot Switching Station to the Phnom Penh Grid.   Sinohydro Kamchay Hydroelectric Project Co., Ltd. served as the Project Owner, the Project Contractor, the Project Operator.  A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on April 8, 2006. It was attended by Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao and the Prime Minister of Cambodia Hu Sen. However, construction did not begin until September 18, 2007. All 8 power generation units were put into operation on December 7, 2011. Then, on August 1, 2012, commercial power generation metering commenced. During project implementation, 2,015 hectares of protected forest were lost due to the flooding for the reservoir, and a total area of 2,291 hectares was destroyed. As the dam was located in a national park, no resettlement was required because there were no villages located upstream of the dam. However, the flooded area was a mixed bamboo forest, which provided raw materials for basket-making, rattan, and wild fruits, which contributed to the livelihoods of the poorer families located downstream.  Under terms of the BOT agreement, Sinohydro sells the electricity generated by the Kamchay Hydroelectric Power Plant to the Electricite du Cambodge.

73318,"China (People's Republic of)","Indonesia","Asia",2016,NA,"Bank of China and China Construction Bank contribute to syndicated loan for Tangguh LNG Train 3 Expansion Project (Linked to Project ID#85359)","On August 3, 2016,  a group of international banks and financial institutions signed a US$2.045 billion syndicated loan agreement with a trustee [HSBC USA (New York)] and Japan International Finance Management (Tangguh) Corporation — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) — for the Tangguh LNG Train 3 Expansion Project. Members of the international bank loan syndicate included joint mandated lead arrangers Mizuho Bank, Bank of China, China Construction Bank, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, DBS Bank, United Overseas Bank, BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation, Korea Development Bank, Shinsei Bank, and KfW Bank on a club basis. The total project debt amounted to US$3.745 billion, which was split into two syndicated tranches, this US$2.045 billion international bank offshore portion and a $100 million domestic Indonesian bank tranche, as well as two bilateral tranches of $1.2 billion (from JBIC) and $400 million (from the Asian Development Bank), respectively. The domestic bank tranche comprised four state-owned Indonesian banks PT. Bank Mandiri (Persero) Tbk., PT. Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) Tbk., PT. Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk., PT. Indonesia Infrastructure Finance.  The deal involved a complex multi-tranche Indonesian trustee borrowing structure (TBS). Under this structure, loans are repaid from an agreed portion of gross proceeds under identified offtake contracts, in this case the liquified natural gas (LNG) SPAs. The buyers make payments directly to the trustee and paying agent [HSBC USA (New York)]. The trustee is also the borrower under the loan agreement with the lenders, and the debt service payments are made from the trustee accounts. Except otherwise provided, the lenders look to this source of debt service for all loans, with no recourse to the project and no security interest in the project assets or contacts. The project’s trustee borrowing structure is innovative compared with other Indonesian trustee borrowing schemes for two reasons. First, the financing structure had to function independently from the schemes used to finance the original Tangguh LNG plant. In addition, the project’s trustee borrowing structure had to be structured to comply with the Bank Indonesia regulation No.16/10/PBI/2014 as amended by Bank Indonesia regulation No 17/23/PBI/2015 (PBI 16/10). Pursuant to PBI 16/10, all export proceeds and foreign exchange debt must be paid onshore into an account maintained with a bank in Indonesia. To ensure compliance with this regulation, the project’s TBS includes a parallel onshore trustee structure.   The purpose of the project is to add a third LNG process train (Train 3) and 3.8 million tons per annum (mtpa) of production capacity to the existing Tangguh LNG facility on the south side of Bintuni Bay in Teluk Bintuni Regency within Papua Barat Province, bringing the total capacity of the plant to 11.4 mtpa. The project also involves the construction of two offshore platforms, 13 new production wells, an expanded LNG loading facility, and supporting infrastructure. The project is expected to reach completion in July 2020 and play an important role in supporting Indonesia's growing energy demand, with 75% of the Train 3 annual LNG production sold to the Indonesian state electricity company PT. PLN (Persero). To address the needs of Papua Barat for electricity, Tangguh has also committed up to 20mmscfd of LNG for sale. The remaining volumes are under contract to Kansai Electric Power Company in Japan, the other foundation buyer for Train 3.   The Tangguh LNG facility is located in Teluk Bintuni Regency, Papua Barat Province of Indonesia and consists of offshore gas production facilities supplying two 3.8 mtpa liquefaction trains that have been in operation since 2009. It is operated by BP Berau Ltd on behalf of the other production sharing contract partners as contractor to SKK Migas. BP Berau Ltd and its affiliates in Indonesia hold a 37.16% interest in the project. Other Tangguh production sharing contract partners are MI Berau B.V. (16.30%), CNOOC Muturi Ltd. (13.90%), Nippon Oil Exploration (Berau), Ltd. (12.23%), KG Berau Petroleum Ltd and KG Wiriagar Petroleum Ltd (10.00%), Indonesia Natural Gas Resources Muturi Inc. (7.35%), and Talisman Wiriagar Overseas Ltd. (3.06%). In March 2020 Indonesia's upstream regulator the Special Task Force for Upstream Oil and Gas Business Activities (SKK Migas) announced that construction of the terminal's third train would be delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Physical distancing was established among workers at the site, leading to a decline from 13,000 workers to 10,000 workers in the third week of March 2020, with plans to reduce on-site workers further to a core group of 3,000. The 3.8-mtpa expansion to the 7.6-mtpa terminal was originally scheduled to be commissioned in Q3 2020 but was delayed to Q3 2021 because of two tsunamis in 2018. Bank of China also contributed to a syndicated loan in 2007 that financed the first two trains of the Tangguh Liquefied Natural Gas Project (see Project ID#85359).","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Commercial Bank|State-owned Commercial Bank","Other Private Sector",371499264.558229,"The purpose of the project is to add a third LNG process train (Train 3) and 3.8 million tons per annum (mtpa) of production capacity to the existing Tangguh LNG facility on the south side of Bintuni Bay in Teluk Bintuni Regency within Papua Barat Province, bringing the total capacity of the plant to 11.4 mtpa.

The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: 4% interest rate, 15-year maturity, and 5-year maturity.  (3) On May 11, 2017, China Eximbank and the Vietnam Ministry of Finance signed an RMB 1.678 million ($250.62 million) government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK GCL No.2017 (24) Total No. (629)] for this railway project (see Project #63214). The loan terms are unknown. This GCL came into effect on December 28, 2017 and the fist disbursement took place on April 28, 2018.  The borrower was to use the proceeds from these loans to partially finance an EPC contract with China Railway Sixth Bureau Group Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of China Railway Group. The purpose of the project is to construct a 13 km light rail — that travels at 80 km per hour — in the capital city of Hanoi that passes through 12 stations: Cat Linh, La Thanh, Thai Ha, Lang, Thuong Dinh, Vanh Dai 3, Phung Khoang, Van Quan, Ha Dong, La Khe, Van Khe, Yen Nghia. The project officially commenced on October 10, 2011 and the new railway line was originally scheduled to launch in June 2015, but the completion date of the project has been postponed at least four times.  The project has encountered multiple problems and delays during implementation. In 2013, the project faced difficulties related to demolition and relocation, including the fact that the terrain was ideal for machinery and the construction site was close to traffic. Then, in 2014, the total cost of the project increased from $552.86 million to $868.04 million, forcing the Government of Vietnam to contract a supplementary loan from China Eximbank (see Project #63214).  In January 2015, the project faced major criticism from the Vietnamese government for multiple accidents during construction. Vietnamese officials and experts have repeatedly raised concerns about the project’s safety, with several accidents killing or injuring workers and passersby. In early 2016, Vietnam’s Ministry of Transport and China Railway Sixth Bureau Group Co., Ltd agreed on a new launch date in December 2016, before correcting themselves that the line would not be launched until early 2017. In February 2017, the railway line’s completion was postponed for another year, with a new launch set for February 2018.  In February 2017, the first set of trains (out of 13 total) was installed on the track . Each train is worth $63.2 million, and manufactured by China's Beijing Subway Rolling Stock Equipment Ltd. In 2018, the project manager submitted a proposal for the railway line to begin a test run in September 2018, setting the date for an official launch to be in 2021. On September 20, 2018, the first stage of a trial run was initiated, which was meant to last 3-6 months. The project is currently slated for completion on April 30, 2021.

The Southern Coastal Highway Improvement Project (SCHIP) has four core objectives: (1) Construction of a 16km, 4 lane highway with safety barriers from Harbour view to Yallahs, to be undertaken by CHEC at a cost of $110 million; (2) Rehabilitation of 96 km of road from Yallahs Bridge in St. Thomas to Port Antonio, in Eastern Portland, along the existing road alignment to reduce corners, improve safety and open up access to lands which may be of touristic value. This work will be administered by Jamaica's National Works Agency (NWA) and executed by local contractors under subcontract from CHEC at a cost of $74 million; (3) Rehabilitation of 26 km of roads from Morant Bay to Cedar Valley along the existing road alignment to reduce corners, improve safety and open access to lands which may be of touristic, housing or agricultural value. This work will be administered by the NWA and executed by local contractors under subcontract from CHEC at a cost of $11.4 million; and (4) The extension of the East West Toll Road from May Pen to Williamsfield, just outside Mandeville at a cost of $188.5 million.   China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) is the contractor responsible for project implementation. Project implementation commenced on November 17, 2019. However, the project has encountered various delays and problems. In June 2022, Jamaica’s Minister of Ministry of Economic Growth and Job Creation, Hon. Everald Warmington, said that dust and the slow pace of work were major complaint of local residents, especially those living in St. Thomas. He told a group of journalists on June 2, 2022 that ‘some subcontractors are not living up to the responsibility of their contract… [and] where [they] are negligent then [CHEC] will step in and have those rectified.’ He also noted that the the commercial contract ‘makes it clear that where the subcontractor is insufficient in performance, [CHEC] is obligated to step in and do the work itself.’ At the same time, he expressed hope that subcontractors, many of whom are from Jamaica, would improve their performance to prevent CHEC from reassuming control for all project components.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Government Agency",376123174.451645,"This project involves the (1) construction of a 16km, 4 lane highway with safety barriers from Harbour view to Yallahs, to be undertaken by CHEC; (2) rehabilitation of 96km of road from Yallahs Bridge in St. Thomas to Port Antonio, in Eastern Portland, along the existing road alignment to reduce corners, improve safety and open up access to lands which may be of touristic value; (3) rehabilitation of 26 km of roads from Morant Bay to Cedar Valley along the existing road alignment to reduce corners, improve safety and open access to lands which may be of touristic, housing or agricultural value; and (4) the extension of the East West Toll Road from May Pen to Williamsfield, just outside Mandeville.

This agreement follows a $400 million pledge from China in 2002 for infrastructure projects (#67275), which includes this power plant. The pledge stated that loans are to be repaid in 15 years with a 7 year grace period and a 3% interest rate. It is known that the borrower was to use the PBC proceeds to partially finance the cost (approximately $232 million) of a commercial (EPC) contract between Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) — an Indonesian state-owned electricity company — and China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC). Then, on November 10, 2009, China Eximbank increased the face value of the PBC by $31,783,000 (as captured in Project ID#61681) through a supplementary agreement (#BLA03042 SLA 1181) with the borrower. $183,544,240.26 was ultimately disbursed through the PBC.

(2013) 49 TOTAL NO. (437)] with the Government of Guinea for the 240MW Kaléta Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project. The PBC, which is captured via Project ID#53003, carries the following terms: 20 year maturity, 9 year grace period, 2% interest rate, and 0.3% management fee. The Government of Guinea used the proceeds from the PBC to on-lend to a project company and special purpose vehicle (SPV) called Société De Gestion de Kaléta (SOGEKA or 凯乐塔电站管理公司).   The borrower (SOGEKA) was to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance 75% of the cost of a $446 million commercial (EPC) contract between China International Water & Electric Corporation and the Government of Guinea, which was signed on August 15, 2011. As of June 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, SOGEKA’s outstanding repayment obligations under the China Eximbank PBC agreement amounted to $404.14 million. SOGEKA also signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the state-owned power utility, Electricité de Guinée (EDG), and agreed that once the Kaléta dam was operational, it would use the proceeds from the sale of electricity (generated by the dam) in order to facilitate the repayment of the China Eximbank loan. When SOGEKA was first established, the Government of Guinea held a 51% equity stake and China International Water & Electric Corporation held a 49% equity stake. However, on November 2, 2016, China Three Gorges Corporation purchased the Government of Guinea’s 51% equity stake for $200 million. The Government of Guinea used the $200 million to meet the requirement in a separate China Eximbank preferential buyer’s credit agreement (captured via Project ID#187) that covers 15% of the total cost ($1.383 billion) of the 450MW Souapiti Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project.   The Kaléta Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project involved the construction of a 240 MW dam that is located 110 km north of Conakry on the Konkouré River. The facility includes a roller-compacted concrete dam 72 feet in height by 5,069 feet in length. The dam impounds a reservoir that has 23 million cubic feet of storage capacity and the facility’s powerhouse has three 80-MW vertical axis Francis turbines. China International Water & Electric Corporation — a subsidiary of China Three Gorges Corporation — was the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor responsible for implementation. Construction began on April 18, 2012. Kaléta dam began to fill water in April 2015. The turbines began to run and distribute electricity ahead of schedule on May 29, 2015. The power plant was constructed according to Chinese technical specifications, and 90% of its electromechanical equipment came from China. The dam was officially put into use on September 29, 2015. Then, an official project completion ceremony took place on October 10, 2015. As of January 31, 2019, the Kaléta hydroelectric power plant had generated 2.708 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity. It reportedly doubled Guinea's electricity supply. Electricity subsidies from the Government of Guinea increased to 0.8% of GDP during the first half of 2019 when the country’s state-owned electricity company, the Public Utility Company (EDG), started to pay for the electricity generated by the  Kaléta Hydroelectric Power Plant in January 2019.   On January 22, 2015, the Government of Guinea also authorized the ratification of a USD $78,064,538.90 loan agreement with China Eximbank for the Conakry Electricity Network Rehabilitation and Extension Project. The borrowing terms of this loan, which are captured via Project ID#91941, are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to finance an amended and expanded version of the commercial (EPC) contract that China International Water & Electric Corporation and the Government of Guinea signed on August 15, 2011. The purpose of this project was to evacuate power from the Kaléta hydroelectric power plant by constructing and rehabilitating 42 km of transmission lines and several substations, including (1) a 110 kV double circuit transmission line between Matoto substation and Manéah (Maneah) substation; (2) a 225 kV transmission line between Kaléta substation and Manéah substation; and (3) Tombo substation. The project also involved the acquisition and installation of electronic metering devices. CWE was the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. However, Guangxi Transmission & Substation Construction Company was also involved as a subcontractor. The commissioning of all substations and transmission lines was completed on July 29, 2015.

The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and a 4% interest rate. On September 30, 2008, the Vietnam Ministry of Finance signed an on-lending agreement (No. 17/ĐLUT/HĐ) with Vietnam National Chemical Group (Vinachem), a Vietnamese state-owned enterprise for this project.  The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the ultimate borrower to partially finance a $480 million EPC contract with China Huanqiu Contracting and Engineering Corporation, which was signed on November 15, 2007.   As of December 31, 2014, China Eximbank had disbursed $225 million of the PBC and ultimately disbursed $249,999,999. As of March 31, 2017, Vinachem had repaid $62.5 million of the principal.  The loan was secured by (i.e. collateralized with) the fertilizer plant that Vinachem developed with the loan proceeds. The Government of Vietnam also issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the China Eximbank PBC.   The Ninh Binh Nitrogenous Fertilizer Plant Construction Project was co-financed by Vinachem, Ninh Binh provincial government, and Vietnam Development Bank.   The purpose of the project was to construct a nitrogenous fertilizer plant (coal-based urea production plant) in Ninh Phuc Industrial Zone within Ninh Binh province. Upon completion, the plant was expected to provide the domestic market with 560,000 tons of urea fertilizer per year.   China Huanqiu Contracting and Engineering Corporation was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. A project commencement ceremony was held on May 10, 2008 and the plant went into use on March 30, 2012 (after 45 months of construction). It began commercial operations in September 2012, and the plant was operating at 90% capacity as of November 2013.   The plant temporarily halted its operations in March 2016 due to financial losses. The plant ended its operations in July 2016.  Then, on April 18, 2017, the Ministry of Industry and Trade issued an official letter (No. 3285 / BCT-HC), announcing that Vinachem was not generating enough cash flow to meet its repayment obligations related to the China Eximbank loan for the Ninh Binh Nitrogenous Fertilizer Plant Construction Project. The plant resumed operations on January 22, 2018 at 80 percent of its designed capacity. However, its indebtedness and lack of access to working capital put its long-run solvency in jeopardy.

The Republic of Argentina subsequently entered into an on-lending arrangement — through a subsidiary loan agreement — with the Government of the Province of Jujuy. The ultimate borrower (the Government of the Province of Jujuy) was expected to use the PBC proceeds to finance approximately 85% of the cost of a $390 million commercial (EPC) contract between Jujuy State Energy and Mining Society (JEMSE) and Shanghai Electric Power Construction Co. Ltd, which was signed on August 12, 2016 and amended on February 3, 2017. The Government of the Province of Jujuy agreed to fund the remainder (15%) of the commercial contract cost through the issuance of green bonds.

This project, which is also known as the Cauchari Solar I, II and III Photovoltaic Parks, involved the installation of 1.2 million solar panels that provide the grid with 312 megawatts of power. Upon completion, the 312 MW complex was expected to generate close to $1 billion in revenue to Jujuy over its first 15 years of operation. It was expected to eventually expand to produce more than 500 megawatts, making it one of the largest solar plants in the world. This photovoltaic park is located in the town of Cauchari.   The provincial energy company, Jujuy State Energy and Mining Society (JEMSE), managed the operation of the solar power complex while construction was executed by Shanghai Electric Power Construction Co. Ltd and Powerchina Ltd. Another Chinese company, Zhongli Talesun Solar Co., Ltd., supplied the 1.18 million solar panels and Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. provided the inverters.   On October 6, 2017, a project construction initiation ceremony was held. The project was officially completed on December 7, 2019.   During the G20 Summit in Argentina from November 30 to December 1, 2018, the Government of Argentina and the People's Republic of China agreed to expand the Cauchari Solar Park in Jujuy, Argentina from a 312 MW solar park to a 500 MW solar park. The Export-Import Bank of China reportedly agreed in principle to issue a $170 million loan (captured via Project ID#69556) to the Government of the Province of Jujuy in Argentina for the 200 MW expansion of the Cauchari Solar Park (known as Cauchari IV and V), which would cover 85% of the total ($200 million) cost of the project. If approved, the China Eximbank loan would require a sovereign guarantee from the central (national) government and carry the following borrowing terms: a 3% interest rate, a 3-year grace period, and a 15-year maturity. The loan approval process will reportedly take up to eight months after a power purchase agreement (PPA) is signed with Cammesa, since China Eximbank will require up to four months to approve the loan. Argentina’s national government will also need up to four months to approve the loan, because it comes with a sovereign guarantee which is already included in the 2021 budget. As of November 2020, the Government of the Province of Jujuy was still negotiating the power purchase agreement (PPA) with Argentina’s energy ministry. If the project is financed, it will also reportedly involve the expansion of a transformer station in Cobos and the construction of a 220-kW high-voltage line from the Altiplano substation to the town of La Quiaca.

JSC KazTransGas (KTG) and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) (acting through Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited) each hold a 50% ownership stake in BSGP. The Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline is a 1,454 km long gas pipeline that runs through the Mangistau, Aktyubinsk, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions. It has a pipe diameter of 1067 mm. The purpose of the project was to ensure stable gas demand in the southern Kazakhstan, reduce dependence on imported gas and ensure the energy security of Kazakhstan. Construction of the pipeline was split into two phases. The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved the construction of 1,143.2 km of pipeline from the Bozoi gas metering station in the Shalkar region of Aktobe Region to Akbulak gas metering station in Sairam of South Kazakhstan Region (now known as the Turkistan Region). It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-1 and Bozoy shift camp in Shalkar region of Aktobe Region, emergency-response centers in Saksaulsk, Aksuat and Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region and an emergency-response center in Shornak within the South Kazakhstan Region, as well as construction of the automated process control system (SCADA) and telecommunication (fiber-optic communication line) for the gas pipeline in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions.   The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project commenced on July 17, 2012. The project was originally expected to be completed by the end of 2012. It was ultimately completed on September 7, 2013, resulting in a throughput capacity of up to 10 bcm per year. The second phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved 306.3 km of gas pipeline construction from Beineu settlement in the Mangystau Region to Bozoi settlement in the Aktobe Region. It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-4 Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region, Beineu gas metering station in Mangystau Region, the SCADA central dispatch control in Kyzylorda, and gas pipeline construction in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions. It was completed on December 30, 2016. Between 2014 and 2017, over 9.0 bcm of gas was transported via the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent gas pipeline, providing the southern regions with Kazakhstani gas. Then, in November 2017, a head compressor station at Bozoi and a line compressor station at Karaozek were put into operation, increasing the capacity of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline to 10 bcm per year. In October 2017, Kazakhstan began exporting gas to China pursuant to a contract concluded between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina for the supply of bcm from October 15, 2017 until October 14, 2018. The price of the gas exported to China pursuant to this agreement was linked to the price of Brent crude oil and determined quarterly. As of December 31, 2017, negotiations were ongoing with respect to a long-term gas supply agreement between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina. BSGP and KazMunayGas expected that the export of gas to China would increase in the future and made plans to construct three new compressor stations on the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline between 2018 and 2019 to handle increased throughput.   In order to fund Phase I of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $1.8 billion USD syndicated loan with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BoC) on December 11, 2012 (captured via Project ID#39562). This loan bore interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 2.7% margin per annum for the duration of the guarantee period (until December 31, 2019) and, thereafter, at a rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 3.2% margin per annum. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in December 2017 until March 11, 2028 (implying a grace period of 5 years and a maturity period of 15.25 years). The loan was secured by corporate guarantees from KazMunayGas and CNPC. In February 2016 and September 2017, amendments were signed because of BSGP's non-compliance with certain project milestones provided for in the facility (Loan) agreement; the milestones were extended until September 30, 2019. These amendments required BSGP's prepayment of $400 million USD of the outstanding indebtedness, which KazMunayGas provided to BSGP for repayment. The loan was secured by additional security, including an offshore account charge, an onshore account pledge and security assignment of BSGP's rights under the shareholder support agreement in favor of the security agent. As of June 30, 2017, the loan’s outstanding amount was $1.462 billion USD. As of December 31, 2017, the loan’s outstanding amount was was $1.0 billion USD. Then, on September 17, 2015, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $700 million USD syndicated loan agreement with CDB and BOC for Phase II of the project to supplement their $1.8 billion USD loan for Phase I. CDB and BoC each contributed $350 million USD to the loan for Phase II. Project ID#73384 captures the BoC contribution. Project ID#40362 captures the CDB contribution. The $700 million loan for Phase II carried a maturity of 15 years (final maturity date: September 17, 2030). Its interest rate is unknown.

The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. Then, in 2017, ICBC and the Government of Zambia signed a $59.58 million loan agreement for the Ndola International Airport Construction Project (captured via Project ID#57092). The borrowing terms of the ICBC loan are unknown. The proceeds of the China Eximbank PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $397,201,694 commercial (EPC) contract between Zambia Airports Corporation Limited (ZACL) and AVIC International Holding Corporation, which was signed on September 11, 2013 and amended on August 25, 2014. The proceeds of the ICBC loan were to be used by the borrower to finance 15% of the cost of the $397,201,694 commercial (EPC) contract between Zambia Airports Corporation Limited (ZACL) and AVIC International Holding Corporation. As of July 2022, the China Eximbank loan had achieved a 57.1% disbursement rate ($192,785,140.88 out of $337,621,439.90).   The project involved the construction of a 12,000 square meter terminal building, 3 aero bridges, a 3.5 kilometer runway, a cargo terminal, a 50-room hotel, a new fire and rescue station, a cargo terminal, an aircraft maintenance hangar, and a fuel farm. AVIC International Holding Corporation was the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. It reportedly fulfilled the government policy of having 20 percent sub-contracting to local contractors by engaging 60 local sub-contractors. 2,700 people were employed during the project construction period.   A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on June 25, 2017. However, the construction site was not handed over to the EPC contractor until September 28, 2017. The EPC contract went into effect and construction began on October 26, 2017. By December 17, 2019, the overall project had achieved a 58% completion rate; the passenger terminal completion rate was 61%, the business complex completion rate was 49%, the air traffic control building completion rate was 54%, the runway, taxiway and apron completion rate was 98%, and the viaduct completion rate was 80%. As of March 2020, the project had achieved an overall completion rate of 60%. As of April 2021, the project had achieved an overall completion rate of 88.9%. The project was originally expected to reach completion on October 20, 2020. However, due to implementation delays related to financing problems and the COVID-19 pandemic, the intended project completion date was pushed out to January 31, 2022. The airport was officially commissioned on August 5, 2021, but the airport was still reportedly waiting for operational certifications at that time. This project has also been plagued by financial problems due to overdue contractor payments. According to Clause 43.1 of the commercial contract between AVIC International Holding Corporation and ZACL, if the client (ZACL) failed to make payment within a stipulated period of time, the EPC contractor (AVIC International Holding Corporation) was entitled to the payment of interest for the late payment, which was to be calculated from the date by which the payment should have been made until the date on which payment was made by applying the interest rate as per local practice. If the payment was delayed for more than 56 days, the EPC contractor would have the right to suspend the works or terminate the commercial contract. Contrary to the clause, AVIC International Holding Corporation had not been paid a total of $97,324,668 being outstanding interim payment certificates (IPCs) for a period of more than fourteen months. In addition, there was no documentation availed to the Auditor General of Zambia to indicate why, despite the financing agreement being in force, the lender had not paid the contractor.   On April 5, 2021, AVIC International Holding Corporation claimed interest on late payments on outstanding IPCs in amounts totaling $1,913,155. AVIC International Senior Consultant, Lei Yingqi, later confirmed that AVIC International Holding Corporation as an EPC contractor was using borrowed funds at high interest rates to ensure that the project continued to progress and the employees continued to be paid. He also indicated that ‘support from abroad was cut off or delayed’, which suggests that the source of the borrowed funds was not China Eximbank or ICBC. Then, on July 29, 2022, the Ministry of Finance & National Planning (MOFNP) of Zambia announced that it was seeking lender approval to formally cancel the China Eximbank loan’s undisbursed balance ($144,836,299.02); however, it also noted that it had not yet secured formal lender approval for this action. This announcement came approximately 21 months after the Government of Zambia defaulted on its repayment obligations to Eurobond holders and approximately 6 weeks after China, France, and 14 other countries formed a creditor committee to discuss the Zambian authorities’ request for a debt treatment under ‘the Common Framework for Debt Treatment beyond the DSSI’ endorsed by the G20 and the Paris Club. MOFNP also announced on July 29, 2022 that it planned to finance the completion of the Ndola International Airport Construction Project with general government revenues, and it signaled its intention to rescope the project to focus on the ‘selected works’ (i.e. access road and completion of the fuel farm).","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient State-owned Company",398664918.352397,"The Ndola International Airport is located in Ndola city in the Copperbelt Province.

Then, on August 2, 2009, CNPC President, Jiang Jiemin, and Chad’s Oil and Mineral Resources Minister, Mahamat Hassan Nasser, signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to apply for a $330 million loan to support the implementation of the $1 billion project. On the same day, a Sino-Chadian joint venture agreement was signed to establish Société de Raffinage de N'Djaména (SRN) SA (恩贾梅纳炼厂有限公司 or 恩贾梅纳炼油公司), which is a special purpose vehicle that is jointly owned by CNPC (60% equity stake) and a Chadian state-owned enterprise called Société des Hydrocarbures du Tchad (SHT) (40% equity stake). Nearly two years later, in May 2011, China Eximbank and SRN SA signed a $330 million buyer's credit loan (BCL) agreement for the N'Djamena Refinery and Pipeline Project (captured via Project ID#72356). The BCL, which was reportedly the first one ever issued by China Eximbank to an overseas joint venture, carried the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and an annual interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 300 basis points.  CNPC provided a repayment guarantee for 60% of the face value of the China Eximbank PBC and SHT provided a repayment guarantee to cover the remaining 40% of the face value of the PBC. CNPC and SHT also pledged their respective shares in Société de Raffinage de N'Djaména (SRN) SA as sources of collateral.  Sinosure refused to insure the BCL, which it deemed too risky. Additionally, CNPC Finance (HK) Limited issued a loan worth approximately $70 million to SRN SA in May 2011 (captured via Project ID#91918). The borrowing terms of the loan from CNPC Finance (HK) Limited are unknown. The proceeds of the China Eximbank BCL and the CNPC Finance (HK) Limited loan were used to fund SHT’s equity contribution (worth approximately 40% of $1 billion) to Société de Raffinage de N'Djaména (SRN) SA.   The N'Djamena Refinery and Pipeline Project had two components: the construction of an oil refinery in Djarmaya that is located to the north of N'Djamena and capable of producing 20,000 to 60,000 barrels a day; and the construction of a 311 km pipeline connecting the Rônier and Mimosa oilfields in Bongor Basin (in eastern-central) Chad to the refinery in Djarmaya (Note: Block H of the Rônier oil field is fully owned by CNPC).   The contractor responsible for project implementation was PetroChina Engineering Construction, which is a subsidiary of PetroChina. Project implementation commenced on October 26, 2008 and reached completion on June 29, 2011. Then, on July 10, 2011, the refinery produced its first batch of diesel fuel. In January 2012, the Government of Chad suspended the oil refinery deal with CNPC and announced that it would expel the Chinese director of the refinery and renegotiate the deal. Disagreements over fuel prices had caused the relationship between the joint venture partners to deteriorate. The refinery restarted operations in February 2012. However, in August 2013, the Government of Chad suspended CNPC’s operations in Chad, accusing CNPC of violating environmental standards at the company’s Rônier oilfield. Work resumed shortly thereafter but was halted again in May 2014, after CNPC refused to pay a $1.2 billion fine. Preparing to take the dispute to international arbitration, the Government of Chad in October 2014 threatened to revoke and re-auction CNPC’s oil exploration licenses.  The dispute was settled the same month when CNPC agreed to pay a $400 million fine and concede to the Government of Chad a 10% stake in existing oil operations in the country, as well as a 25% stake in future oil operations. In exchange, the arbitration case was dropped and CNPC was permitted to export oil through the Chad-Cameroon pipeline.   There are indications that the China Eximbank loan for the N'Djamena Refinery and Pipeline Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  After a sharp decline in oil prices in 2014-2015, Chad experienced an economic recession and a debt crisis and Société de Raffinage de N’djamena (SRN) SA sought to renegotiate the borrowing terms of the China Eximbank loan for the N'Djamena Refinery and Pipeline Project. A rescheduling agreement was finalized in April 2017: China Eximbank agreed to the lengthen the maturity of the loan and reschedule arrears that had accumulated (as captured via Project ID#55744). It appears that China Eximbank did not require the accumulated arrears to be repaid before rescheduling the maturity of the loan.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Other Joint Venture/Special Purpose Vehicle|Recipient State-owned Company",405860459.842621,"This project involved the construction of an oil refinery in Djarmaya (north of N'Djamena), construction of a 311 km pipeline connecting the Ronier and Mimosa oilfields in Bongor Basin (In eastern-central) Chad to the refinery in Djarmaya.

Then, on June 14, 2006 at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, China Development Bank (CDB) signed a $200 million buyer's credit loan agreement with the Moynak Hydropower Plant (HPP) Station Joint Stock Company (JSC) — a special purpose vehicle — for the 300 MW Moynak Hydropower Plant Construction Plant Project (also known as the Moinak Hydro Power Plant or Мойнақ СЭС-і). In addition to the $200 million CDB loan, the Development Bank of Kazakhstan JSC (DBK) provided loans worth $118.6 million and Moynak HPP JSC itself made a $28 million equity contribution to the $346.6 million independent power plant (IPP) project. The borrowing terms of the CDB loan included a 6.69% interest rate (LIBOR plus 120 basis points) and a 20-year maturity. The borrower was also expected to maintain a minimum cash balance of 5.6 billion tenge (approximately $44,153,591) in a lender-controlled bank (cash collateral) account. The Government of Kazakhstan provided a sovereign guarantee for repayment half of the face value of the loan and Samruk-Energy Group provided a corporate guarantee for up to $50 million. Moynak HPP JSC (also known was Moinak HPP JSC) drew down $196,337,143 from the $200 million CDB loan. As such, the loan achieved a 98% disbursement rate. On June 20, 2019, the borrower (project company) fully repaid the loan’s principal amount and interest ahead of schedule with funds from the issuance of bonds purchased by its parent company, Samruk-Energy.    According to an August 2019 briefing by Director of the Treasury and Corporate Finance Department of Samruk-Energo JSC Sergey Li, early repayment (prepayment) of the USD-denominated loan reduced the share of foreign currency debt in its loan portfolio from 17% to 3%, reduced the negative effect of currency fluctuations, and freed up the 5.6 billion tenge (approximately $44,153,591) cash deposit in the lender-controlled bank (cash collateral) account. The borrower was allowed to use to cash deposit in the collateral account to facilitate prepayment. Early repayment (prepayment) also resulted in the release of the corporate guarantee of Samruk-Kazyna JSC in the amount of $50 million, thereby eliminating a contingent liability.    Construction of the 300 MW hydroelectric plant started in 1985 but then stopped in 1992 due to the collapse of the Soviet Union. Thanks to the CDB financing, construction of the power plant started again. The Moynak plant was designed to house two 150 MW turbines that could generate 1.27 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. The project sought to end energy shortages in southern Kazakhstan with its reliable energy, enabling growth in the industrial sector of the region.    China International Water and Electric Corporation (CWE), China Geo-Engineering Corporation (CGC), and Chengdu Hydropower Investigation and Design Institute (CHIDI) jointly implemented the Moynak Hydropower Plant Construction Project. The project included the design, manufacturing, supply, installation, commissioning, training, and maintenance for the plant, with a quality assurance period for major equipment of 20 years. The station was expected to be completed and put into operation in December 2009. A project commencement ceremony was held on August 8, 2008.

The contract included 15 years of operational support services, a comprehensive training program, and an insurance policy. The NigComSat-1 Communications Satellite Project officially commenced on February 21, 2005. Then, on January 12, 2006, China Eximbank and the Government of Nigeria signed a $200,000,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the NigComSat-1 Communications Satellite Project. The PBC carried the following terms: a 12 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, and a 3% interest rate. The final maturity date of the loan is March 21, 2018. As of December 31, 2020, Nigeria’s Debt Management Office (DMO) reported that the China Eximbank PBC (loan) had achieved a 100% disbursement rate ($200 million) and the borrower had made interest repayments worth $40.02 million and principal repayments worth $200 million to the lender. As such, the loan’s (principal) amount outstanding, as of December 31, 2020, was $0. According to Nigeria’s DMO, the loan was fully repaid as of June 29, 2018.   In anticipation of the launch of Nigeria’s first communications satellite, Nigeria’s Federal Ministry of Communications Technology established a state-owned company called Nigerian Communications Satellite (NIGCOMSAT) Limited on April 4, 2006. It was envisaged that NIGCOMSAT Limited would sell fixed satellite services to much of Africa and Italy. The NigcomSat-1 communications satellite was equipped with 28 transponders on board in four frequency bands (8 Ka-band, 14 Ku-band, 4C-band and 2 L-band). In order to satisfy the coverage area requirements, the satellite was fitted with a total of seven shaped communication antennae. With a lift-off mass of 5,086 kg, the satellite was to be positioned at 42 degrees east longitude over the equator, with an end-of-life power of over 8KW, and a design orbit life span of 15 years.   On May 14, 2007, NigComSat-1 was successfully launched from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center (XSLC) aboard an enhanced LM-3B (LM-3B/E) launch vehicle. Then, on July 6, 2007, CGWIC delivered the NigComSat-1 satellite in orbit to Nigerian Communications Satellite Ltd. (NigComSat Ltd.), along with a tracking station in Kashi of China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and one fully operational ground station in Lugbe district within the capital city of Abuja. A project completion ceremony was held on July 16, 2007. NigComSat-1 was China's first commercial in-orbit delivery telecommunications satellite. However, on November 11, 2008, NigComSat-1 failed in orbit after running out of power due to solar array anomaly. On March 24, 2009, the Nigerian Federal Ministry of Science and Technology, NigComSat Ltd. and CGWIC sighed a commercial contract for the in-orbit delivery of a replacement communications satellite for NigComSat-1 called NigcomSat-1R.   The commercial contract for NigcomSat-1R was partially financed with insurance from the original commercial contract for NigComSat-1. It was also financed with a second loan from China Eximbank. In 2010, China Eximbank and the Government of Nigeria signed a $20.1 million loan agreement for the NigComSat-1 Communications Satellite Replacement Project (or NigComSat-1R Communications Satellite Project). The borrowing terms of this loan are unknown, but Nigeria’s Debt Management Office (DMO) refers to the loan as “largely concessional”.   The NigComSat-1 Communications Satellite Replacement Project officially commenced on May 29, 2009. After making technical improvements to address the issues led to the de-orbiting of NIGCOMSAT-1, Nigeria's National Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA) and CGWIC successfully launched NIGCOMSAT-1R into orbit on December 19, 2011. At the time, Nigeria’s President, Goodluck Jonathan, said that NIGCOMSAT-1R would have a positive impact on national development in various sectors such as communications, internet services, health, agriculture, environmental protection and national security.

According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the ETB 4,053,424,658 loan achieved a 111% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 15 loan disbursements (worth ETB 4,499,623,058) between 2014 and 2019: an ETB 234,280,303 disbursement on October 8, 2013, an ETB 158,812,261 disbursement on January 8, 2014, an ETB 194,174,757 disbursement on April 8, 2014, an ETB 1,200,000,000 disbursement on October 8, 2014, an ETB 404,040,404 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 265,556,593 disbursement on April 8, 2015, an ETB 102,387,246 disbursement on July 8, 2015, an ETB 405,453,493 disbursement on October 7, 2015, an ETB 153,171,320 disbursement on January 7, 2016, an ETB 244,603,535 disbursement on April 7, 2016, an ETB 145,293,164 disbursement on July 7, 2016, an ETB 27,576,322 disbursement on October 7, 2016, an ETB 522,418,088 disbursement on January 7, 2017, an ETB 45,062,662 disbursement on April 7, 2017, and an ETB 396,792,911 disbursement on March 27, 2019.   The purpose of the project was to construct the 254MW Genale-Dawa III multipurpose hydropower plant. The plant consists of a concrete faced rock fill dam and an underground powerhouse. Based on the estimated sedimentation level, the project will have a lifetime of more than 1,000 years. The dam site is located in a low seismic hazard area of class I. The dam is 110m high, 456m wide and 450m long. It is made with groutable and non-erodible rock and has a volume of 3.2 million cubic metres (mm3). At the full capacity, the dam can store up to 2,570mm3 of water. It has a catchment area of 10,445km2 and a fill volume of 890,000m3. The dam spillway is an open chute type with an ogee weir crest and three radial spillway gates. The underground powerhouse is installed with three vertical Francis turbine generators with a capacity of 84.7MW each. It is housed within an underground cavern measuring 60m-long, 20m-wide and 41m deep and also includes auxiliary equipment. A 12.4km long, 8.1m diameter headrace tunnel carries water from the dam through a 188m deep steel-lined vertical shaft to a three-pronged manifold. The manifold feeds the water to the turbine inlet valves of the three turbines housed in the powerhouse. A 820m long tailrace tunnel and a 480m long open channel returns the water back to the river. A transformer cavern is located downstream of the powerhouse and includes three step-up transformers. The electricity generated is transferred from the transformers to a 230kV/400kV switchyard located above ground through a 500m long cable tunnel.   The project area is located in Kobadi, some 400 km (air distance) south-east of Addis Ababa and some 200 km (air distance) north of the border with Kenya. The scheme, including the reservoir and power waterways, extends over a river corridor some 55 km long. The approximate centroid of the project area lies at latitude 5º 38' North and longitude 39º 43' East.   CGGC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. However, several other contractors were involved in the project. Stantec, a US-based company, provided design, planning, management and consulting services. Lahmeyer International, a German company, conducted the feasibility study. Tunnelpro, an Italy-based supplier, provided tunnel boring machines.   Project implementation commenced in March 2011 and the project was originally expected to commence on January 1, 2010 and reach completion within 48.5 months (January 15, 2014). However, the project encountered multiple implementation delays. An inauguration ceremony was held to commemorate the project’s completion on February 4, 2020. The project temporarily employed 390 Ethiopian workers.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the 254MW Genale Dawa III Hydroelectric Power Station Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient State-owned Company|Recipient Government Agency|Other Private Sector|Other Private Sector|Other Private Sector",412146528.976398,"The 254MW Genale Dawa III Hydroelectric Power Plant is located in Kobadi, Ethiopia.

The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 3% interest rate, a 15-year grace maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 0.2% management fee, and a 0.2% commitment fee. Then, on March 5, 2015, the Government of Indonesia signed a $373,009,532.12 subsidiary loan agreement [SLA-1261/DSMI/2015] with Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) — an Indonesian state electricity distribution company — for the same project. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by PLN to partially finance an EPC contract that it signed with Sinohydro Corporation Limited in July 2013.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 440MW power plant with two power generation units in Pasir Village within Pangkalan Susu District, Langkat Regency, North Sumatra Province (exact locational coordinates: 4.12071, 98.25823).   Sinohydro Corporation Limited was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Unit 2 went online in July 2014, and Unit 1 was undergoing testing as of February 2015. However, the introduction of the power plant was delayed in February 2015, after steel was stolen from the three of the plant's transmission towers, causing them to collapse. It was unclear whether the person responsible was trying to steal and sell the metal, or trying to stop the plant from operating. The project finally entered implementation on May 4, 2015. Then, in June 2015, PLN said that Unit 1 was operating. However, as of the fourth quarter of 2016, the project had only achieved a 45.47% completion rate.

Following the signing of the framework agreement, on March 2, 2004, China Eximbank entered into a $2 billion Master Loan Facility Agreement (MLFA) with the Government of Angola. All borrowings under the MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility,  carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  The facility was split between a $1.0 billion Phase I facility and a $1.0 billion Phase II facility.  Availability of the Phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA is a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank may conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts.  The first tranche of the facility was released in December 2004.  The facility was fully drawn down as of December 31, 2017.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections. The process was managed by an office in the Angolan Ministry of Finance -- known as Gabinete de Apoio Técnico (GAT) -- that was specifically created to manage the MLFA with China Eximbank.  In February 2005, China Eximbank and the Government of Angola signed a $190,515,690.59 subsidiary buyer’s credit loan agreement under the MLFA for the 357 km Quifangondo-Caxito-Uige-Negage Highway Rehabilitation Project.  The proceeds of the loan were used to partially finance a $211,684,100.65 commercial (EPC) contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), which was signed on February 8, 2005.  This project also received a supplementary $50,702,850.00 loan from China Eximbank through a $500 million MLFA (as captured via Project ID#34030) extended to the Government of Angola on July 19, 2007.  This subsidiary loan carried the following estimated borrowing terms: a 21.5 maturity, a 1.5 year grace period, an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 1.5% margin, a 0.3% management fee, and a 0.3% commitment fee. The proceeds of the loan were used to partially finance a supplementary commercial contract with CRBC worth $56,336,500.00.    Project ID#34853 captures the first loan, and Project ID#66 captures the second, supplementary loan.  The purpose of this project, which employed 1336 Angolan workers and 367 Chinese workers, was the rehabilitation of a 357 km highway between Quifangondo and Negage via Caxito and Uige. The starting point of the road is in the town of Kifangondo, a northern suburb of Luanda City.  It extends northward through the city of Caxito, the capital of Bengo Province and the city of Uige, the capital of Uige Province.  The road terminates in the city of Negage, an important agricultural town within Uige Province.  CRBC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. The EPC contract supporting the project went into effect on December 13, 2005 and the originally expected project handover date was June 30, 2008.  The project officially commenced on December 13, 2005 and a project handover ceremony took place on August 30, 2008.

By July 23, 2014, a senior management team was in place at Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. In November 2014, a project feasibility study report was approved after an assessment was made by experts from the Electric Power Planning & Engineering Institute (EPPEI) and the Government of Punjab. On November 21, 2014, SEPCO1 Electric Power Construction Corporation was selected as the EPC contractor through bidding.  Then, in February 2017, four Chinese state-owned commercial banks — the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Bank of China (BOC), China Construction Bank (CCB), and Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) — signed a $1.44 billion syndicated buyer’s credit (facility) agreement with Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. for the Sahiwal 2 x 660 MW Coal-Fired Power Plant Project. The estimated borrowing terms of the buyer’s credit are as follows: a 14-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, an all-in 4.95% interest rate (6-month LIBOR plus a 4.5% margin), and a 5.26% Sinosure insurance premium. The Government of Pakistan also issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan and granted a 27.2% guaranteed return on equity to the project sponsors (investors).  ICBC's contribution is captured via Project ID#52659. BOC's contribution is captured via Project ID#92302. CCB's contribution is captured via Project ID#92303. ABC's contribution is captured via Project ID#92304.  The total cost of the Sahiwal 2 x 660 MW Coal-Fired Power Plant Project was $1.808 billion. It was implemented as an Independent Power Project (IPP) — as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) Initiative — and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25. Project ID #52659 captures the debt financing component and Project ID#54134 captures the equity financing component.  The purpose of the project was to construct 1320 MW coal-fired power plant — with two 660 MW supercritical coal-fired units (Unit 1 and Unit 2) — with synchronous installation of high-efficiency electrostatic precipitator and flue gas desulfurization facilities. The project site is located about 12 miles from Sahiwal and 9.3 miles from Okara cantonment, just north of the road which connects the two towns, in Pakistan's Punjab Province. Its exact locational coordinates are 30°42′55″N 73°14′20″E. The 690 hectare project site was given to the Chinese side by the Pakistani government free of charge. PowerChina Nuclear Engineering Company and SEPCO1 Electric Power Construction Corporation (a subsidiary of PowerChina) were the general EPC contractors responsible for implementation.  A groundbreaking ceremony was held on May 30, 2014. Foundation soil replacement and pile foundation tests commenced on February 6, 2015. Construction began on July 31, 2015. Unit 1 passed a 168-hour full-load trial operation and was put into operation on May 24. 2017. Unit 2 passed a 168-hour full-load trial operation and was put into operation on June 8. 2017. All network-related tests were completed on October 12, 2017. The project achieved its Commercial Operations Date (COD) and the power plant was connected to the national grid on October 28, 2017. As part of a build, operate, transfer (BOT) agreement, the power plant's ownership is to be transferred from the project company to the Government of Punjab after 30 years of operation.  However, this project has encountered a number of revenue generation, debt repayment, and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. In April 2018, reports emerged that the Government of Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 20 billion (approximately $172 million), which reportedly brought the Sahiwal 2 x 660 MW Coal-Fired Power Plant Project to ‘to the brink of closure’. It also made it more difficult for Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. to source the coal needed to power the plant (since Pakistan Railway demands advance payment for coal transportation). Then, in a letter dated August 7, 2022, Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. acknowledged that more than 0.5 million tons of South African coal were being stored in Port Qasim and awaiting clearance because it was unable to pay the coal supplier.   Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this “[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan.

(and its subsidiary in Hong Kong) and Shandong Ruyi Technology Group Co., Ltd. (and its subsidiary in Hong Kong) was granted a Letter of Intention (LOI) by the Government of Pakistan, thereby officially obtaining the right to develop the Sahiwal 2 x 660 MW Coal-Fired Power Plant Project. One day later, on May 22, 2014, Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. — a special purpose vehicle (project company) and joint venture of Huaneng Shandong Power Generation Co. Ltd. (51% ownership stake) and Shandong Ruyi Science & Technology Group (49% ownership stake) — was officially incorporated and established to assume responsibility for the development, investment, and management the two 660 MW coal-fired units in Sahiwal.  By July 23, 2014, a senior management team was in place at Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. In November 2014, a project feasibility study report was approved after an assessment was made by experts from the Electric Power Planning & Engineering Institute (EPPEI) and the Government of Punjab. On November 21, 2014, SEPCO1 Electric Power Construction Corporation was selected as the EPC contractor through bidding.  Then, in February 2017, four Chinese state-owned commercial banks — the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Bank of China (BOC), China Construction Bank (CCB), and Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) — signed a $1.44 billion syndicated buyer’s credit (facility) agreement with Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. for the Sahiwal 2 x 660 MW Coal-Fired Power Plant Project. The estimated borrowing terms of the buyer’s credit are as follows: a 14-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, an all-in 4.95% interest rate (6-month LIBOR plus a 4.5% margin), and a 5.26% Sinosure insurance premium. The Government of Pakistan also issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan and granted a 27.2% guaranteed return on equity to the project sponsors (investors).  ICBC's contribution is captured via Project ID#52659. BOC's contribution is captured via Project ID#92302. CCB's contribution is captured via Project ID#92303. ABC's contribution is captured via Project ID#92304.  The total cost of the Sahiwal 2 x 660 MW Coal-Fired Power Plant Project was $1.808 billion. It was implemented as an Independent Power Project (IPP) — as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) Initiative — and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25. Project ID #52659 captures the debt financing component and Project ID#54134 captures the equity financing component.  The purpose of the project was to construct 1320 MW coal-fired power plant — with two 660 MW supercritical coal-fired units (Unit 1 and Unit 2) — with synchronous installation of high-efficiency electrostatic precipitator and flue gas desulfurization facilities. The project site is located about 12 miles from Sahiwal and 9.3 miles from Okara cantonment, just north of the road which connects the two towns, in Pakistan's Punjab Province. Its exact locational coordinates are 30°42′55″N 73°14′20″E. The 690 hectare project site was given to the Chinese side by the Pakistani government free of charge. PowerChina Nuclear Engineering Company and SEPCO1 Electric Power Construction Corporation (a subsidiary of PowerChina) were the general EPC contractors responsible for implementation.  A groundbreaking ceremony was held on May 30, 2014. Foundation soil replacement and pile foundation tests commenced on February 6, 2015. Construction began on July 31, 2015. Unit 1 passed a 168-hour full-load trial operation and was put into operation on May 24. 2017. Unit 2 passed a 168-hour full-load trial operation and was put into operation on June 8. 2017. All network-related tests were completed on October 12, 2017. The project achieved its Commercial Operations Date (COD) and the power plant was connected to the national grid on October 28, 2017. As part of a build, operate, transfer (BOT) agreement, the power plant's ownership is to be transferred from the project company to the Government of Punjab after 30 years of operation.  However, this project has encountered a number of revenue generation, debt repayment, and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. In April 2018, reports emerged that the Government of Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 20 billion (approximately $172 million), which reportedly brought the Sahiwal 2 x 660 MW Coal-Fired Power Plant Project to ‘to the brink of closure’. It also made it more difficult for Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. to source the coal needed to power the plant (since Pakistan Railway demands advance payment for coal transportation).

The PBC (loan), which went into effect on August 18, 2016, carried the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and a 3% interest rate. The loan’s principal was to be repaid by the borrower in thirty equal semiannual installments on January 21 and July 21 of each year and the first repayment was scheduled to commence on the first available payment date falling five years after the date of withdrawal (November 2, 2016).  The lender expected the borrower to use the revenues from an Airport Development Fee (ADF) to repay the loan.  The Maldives Ministry of Finance and Treasury used the proceeds of the China Eximbank loan to on-lend to Maldives Airports Company Limited (MACL) — a state-owned enterprise in the Maldives — in local currency (Maldivian Rufiyaa). As of December 31, 2018, China Eximbank had disbursed $211,137,789. It made additional disbursements worth $6,255,639 during calendar year 2020 and $38,474,600 during calendar year 2021.

China Eximbank agreed to cover 82% of the total project cost, with the Government of Pakistan covering the remaining 18%. This 'mixed credit' arrangement produced four different financial commitments: two preferential buyer's credits (PBC), one government concessional loan (GCL), and one buyer's credit loan (BCL).

Additionally, on December 18, 2015, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed a $2.25 billion buyer’s credit loan (BCL) [Government of Pakistan loan ID#BC-BLA201401 and BCL 2015212932] carrying a 6% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 8 year grace period (captured via Project ID#41917).  The Government of Pakistan on-lent some or all of the proceeds of the China Eximbank loans to Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) -- a federally funded independent governmental agency -- at a 15% interest rate. The Government of Pakistan also reportedly issued sovereign guarantees for all four China Eximbank loans that supported the project. In December 2015, the amounts outstanding under all four China Eximbank loans (worth $5.668 billion) were reportedly transferred by the Government of Pakistan to PAEC (as the direct borrower).   The purpose of the project was to construct units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP), which is located in Paradise Point in Karachi within Sindh Province.  China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. It is using Hualon One technology (the CNNC's third-generation nuclear reactor design) to construct Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on November 26, 2013. Then, a major milestone was reached at the K-2 reactor when so-called ‘cold functional tests’ began on November 26, 2019. Cold functional tests are carried out to confirm whether the main system and its supporting facilities are properly installed and ready to operate under high-pressure conditions. K-2 was ultimately connected to the national grid on March 18, 2021. It was officially inaugurated on May 21, 2021 and put into operation on May 24, 2021. The K-3 reactor came online on March 4, 2022. The project was originally expected to reach completion by the end of 2020.  There are some indications that the $382.8 million preferential buyer’s credit for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In May 2019, PAEC sought the Prime Minister's approval to have the interest rates of the China Eximbank loans for Units 2 and 3 of the KANUPP Project reset to their original levels (when they were first issued by China Eximbank). Local sources reported at the time that the electricity tariff determined by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) was set on the basis of actual electricity generation costs and on-lending at a 15% rate increased actual electricity generation costs by PKR 108 billion (necessitating an PKR 1.8/kWh increase in the tariff rate). However, it is unclear if the Prime Minister approved PAEC’s request. Then, on or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement.

The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a maturity of 15 years, a grace period of 2 years, and an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3.3% margin. The loan is backed by a sovereign guarantee from the Ministry of Finance and Treasury of the Government of Maldives. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of a $434 million commercial contract with China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC). HDC contracted a $65.1 million loan from the Singapore Branch of Credit Suisse AG on December 13, 2017 to finance the other 15% of the commercial contract cost.

(2014) 6 TOTAL NO. (300)] with Cameroon's Ministry of Economy, Planning, and Regional Development (MINEPAT) for the Kribi-Lolabe Highway Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a commitment fee of 0.25%, a management fee of 0.25%, a grace period of 5 years, and a maturity of 20 years. The borrower agreed to deposit project-related revenues in a special account to facilitate repayment. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the total cost ($453,892,716.00) of a commercial contract between the Steering and Monitoring Committee of the Kribi Industrial and Port Complex of Cameroon and China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd., which was signed on November 28, 2012. The remaining 15% was to be covered by the Government of Cameroon's MINEPAT.   As of December 31, 2020, the loan (PBC) had achieved a 80.6% disbursement rate (with an undisbursed balance of CFA 40.1 billion). The loan’s outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 163.5 billion as of December 31, 2020.   The purpose of this 38.5 km (+4.5km) highway construction project is to facilitate access to the Kribi deep-sea port. It involves construction of a 38.5 km 2x2-lane highway, starting from Mboro village and running to Bibolo in the Kribi II district. It also includes the construction of 4.5 km of road that connects Kribi-Lolabe highway to the Edéa-Kribi highway (or Nationale 7 Edéa-Kribi).   China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd. is the contractor responsible for implementation. Construction commenced on January 1, 2015. However, it was temporarily halted on November 26, 2018 due to (a) the failure to appoint a highway operator, (b) the failure to sign an escrow account agreement, and (c) and accumulated payment arrears worth CFA 75.5 billion. As of March 2019, the project had achieved an 88% completion rate. Then, during last few months of 2019, construction was again temporarily halted before resuming in January 2020. CHEC and the Cameroon Ministry of Public Works stated that the project had achieved an 88.14% completion as of January 2020. Then, on December 30, 2020, Cameroon’s Minister of Public Works and Minister of Finance signed a public-private partnership (PPP) contract with CHEC to finance the Cameroonian Government’s 15% of the project cost, tacitly acknowledging that the Cameroonian Government could not honor its commitment to finance 15% of the commercial contract cost due to a series of crises. The timeline for completion of the project was subsequently revised to August 2021. As of November 3, 2021, the project had achieved a 98.19% completion rate. The project achieved provisional acceptance (completion) on December 31, 2021.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Kribi-Lolabe Highway Construction Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.’","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company",427127092.23645,"More detailed locational information can be found at https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/421657409#map=14/2.8515/9.9337 and https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/421657407#map=13/2.9142/9.9281 and https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/520618381#map=15/2.9742/9.9540 and https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/520618378 and https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/421657410","Lower middle income","Precise","Yes"

(IC Ictas-Astaldi or ICA) — a joint venture between an Italian construction company called Astaldi S.P.A (33.33% ownership stake) and a Turkish construction company called IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S. (66.66% ownership stake) — for the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project (also known as the Third Bosphorus Bridge PPP Project and the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge PPP Project). 30 months of the 10-year concession is for bridge construction activities and the remaining period is for bridge management activities. The public-private partnership (PPP) project was implemented on a BOT (Build, Operate, Transfer) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20. The original, non-recourse $2.67 billion debt financing package consisted of two syndicated loan agreements with two different special purpose vehicles (project companies): a $1.04 billion loan with Avrupa Otoyolu Yatirim ve Iletme A.S. for the 171 km Kurtköy-Akyazı Section (“Asia Section” or “NMM Asia”) of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project and a $1.63 billion loan with KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. for the 90 km Kınalı-Odayeri Section (“Europe Section” or “NMM Europe”) of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project. The loan agreements were signed in September 2013 and financial close was achieved May 2014. The loan were issued by six local banks, including Turkish banks (Türkiye Garanti Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Is Bankasi A.S., QNB Finansbank A.S., T.C. Ziraat Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. and Türkiye Vakiflar Bankasi T.A.O.). One loan will mature in December 2022 (with a fixed interest rate of 7.6%) and the other will mature in June 2024 (with a floating interest rate of LIBOR + 550 basis points).   Additionally, $600 million of equity financing was provided by Astaldi S.P.A and IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S.: $387.33 million IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S. and $193.67 million from Astaldi S.P.A. The Government of Turkey issued a sovereign guarantee, agreeing to repay the debt incurred by borrower/project company (IC Ictas-Astaldi) in the event that it defaulted on its repayment obligations. The Government of Turkey’s General Directorate of Highways (KGM) also provided a minimum traffic guarantee to the project company (to secure the payback of the debt and equity if the generated revenue was insufficient).   Then, in 2018, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's branch in Turkey (ICBC Turkey) was mandated by IC Ictas-Astaldi to lead and arrange syndication for the refinancing of $2.67 billion of debt used to construct the Third Bosphorus Bridge (or Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge) and North Marmara Motorway PPP Project. A letter of authorization for the refinancing was signed at the One Belt, One Road Investment and Financial Cooperation Summit in Ankara on July 26, 2018. Under the agreement, ICBC Turkey agreed in principle to facilitate the refinancing of the project, previously funded by the Turkish banking system, on more favorable terms.   Then, in September 2019, two syndicated loan agreements worth $4.435 billion were signed (with ICBC serving as the lead arranger) for the Kurtköy-Akyazı and Kınalı-Odayeri sections of the project: a $2,840,000,000 loan agreement was signed by KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. and a group of ten lenders (ICBC Turkey, Bank of China, Kuveyt Türk Katilim Bankasi A.S., Albaraka Türk Katılım Bankası A.Ş., Türkiye Garanti Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Is Bankasi A.S., QNB Finansbank A.S., T.C.

The two loans have two different maturity lengths, reflecting the different concession lengths of the two sponsors. The Government of Turkey issued a sovereign guarantee for both loans on September 16, 2019. The total amount that was reportedly provided (across both loans) by ICBC Turkey was $1 billion (as captured via Project ID#67325). Bank of China’s estimated contribution to both loans ($381,666,666) is captured via Project ID#67331.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 1.408 kilometer long-span bridge to be used by road vehicles and trains to cross the Bosphorus Strait from Poyrazkoy in Asia to Garipce in Europe, as well as the construction of a section of the North Marmara Highway along the Odayeri-Pasakoy route. The bridge is 59 meters long and it stretches 1,408 meters over the Bosporus, linking the European and Asian sides of Istanbul. It has eight highway lanes (4 in each direction), divided by two high-speed rail corridors of 1,048 meters. The bridge is a critical part of the larger Northern Marmara Highway (Motorway) Project, linking to the Odayeri-Pasaköy route of the Motorway. The 261 km km Northern Marmara Highway was intended to increase economic efficiency in Turkey, allow for greater access to Istanbul Airport, provide alternate routes to going through Istanbul, and start on the western side of Istanbul and end in the eastern Marmara province of Sakarya. ICA IC İçtaş Astaldi Üçüncü Boğaz Köprüsü ve Kuzey Marmara Otoyolu Yatırım ve İşletme A.Ş. (IC Ictas-Astaldi) was responsible for project implementation. Construction began in September 2012 using the SPV's equity, and was originally expected to take 36 months. The Odayeri-Paşaköy section of the motorway was completed August 26, 2016. The Kurtköy-Akyazı section of the project was completed and opened to traffic on December 19, 2020.   On December 23, 2019, China Merchants Expressway Network & Technology Holdings Co. Ltd, China Merchants Union (BVI) Limited, Jiangsu Expressway Company Limited, Zhejiang Expressway Co. Ltd., Anhui Expressway Company Limited and Sichuan Expressway Co announced that it had entered an agreement and jointly set up a consortium company (“Consortium Company”) to acquire: (1) 51% equity stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi (the SPV responsible for the Third Bosphorus Bridge PPP Project); (2) 51% of a related shareholder loan of IC Ictas-Astaldi; and (3) 51% equity stake in Eurasia Motorway Maintenance and Operations Limited (“IC Maintenance”), a company engages in the operations and maintenance of projects operated by IC Ictas-Astaldi. Shareholders of the Consortium Company expected to invest up to $688.5 million. As a part of the acquisition, China Merchants, China Merchants United, Zhejiang Expressway, Jiangsu Expressway, Sichuan Expressway and Anhui Expressway held 31%, 20%, 17.5%, 17.5%, 7% and 7% equity stakes in the Consortium Company, respectively. Upon completion of the acquisition, the Zhejiang Expressway Co., Ltd. would indirectly hold an 8.925% equity stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi, 8.925% of the related shareholder loan of IC Ictas-Astaldi, and an 8.925% equity stake in IC Maintenance, respectively. However, the preliminary agreement that was signed on December 23, 2019 was interrupted due to the Covid-19 pandemic. ICBC, Bank of China, and China Merchants Bank subsequently indicated that they were willing to issue a $1.6 billion loan to the Consortium Company in 2021 to facilitate their acquisition of a 51% ownership stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi for $688.5 million. Their loan would mature in 2027, just before the project company’s concession expired. Sinosure would provide credit insurance. However, IJ Global reported in August 2021 that the Chinese companies in the Consortium Company requested to enter into negotiations to terminate the acquisition agreement. Then, in March 2020, Astaldi sold its stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi (the SPV) to IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S., with the latter becoming the sole owner.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Commercial Bank","Other Joint Venture/Special Purpose Vehicle",428827159.597673,"The purpose of the project was to construct a 1.408 kilometer long-span bridge to be used by road vehicles and trains to cross the Bosporus Strait from Poyrazkoy in Asia to Garipce in Europe, as well as the construction of a section of the North Marmara Highway along the Odayeri-Pasakoy route.

The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower received a $350 million ‘advance payment’ from the lender and it was allowed to repay the loan with cash or coal from Tavan Tolgoi, which is a coal deposit located in the Ömnögovi Province in southern Mongolia.   When the loan agreement was signed, ETT and Chalco also signed a long-term steelmaking coal supply contract. Under the term of this contract, Chalco agreed to purchase coal from ETT at a price of $70 per ton (well below the $200+ per-ton price of Australian coking coal). In 2012, ETT sold 2.4 million tons of coking coal to Chalco, 3 million tons less than it had originally planned to export. Then, on January 11, 2013, ETT halted coal deliveries to Chalco and announced that it would only supply coal to Chalco if the Chinese state-owned company revised the prices and volumes in the July 2011 supply contract. According to ETT, it was losing $5 on every ton of coal delivered because of rising transportation costs and the price that Chalco was paying for the coal. ETT also claimed that prices were set below the actual cost of extracting and delivering the coal. In March 2013, ETT failed to honor an $86 million loan repayment obligation to Chalco.   Then, in April 2013, ETT agreed to pay a higher interest rate on its total outstanding debt ($186 million) to Chalco as part of an agreement to resume coal deliveries. ETT restarted coal shipments to Chalco on April 22, 2013 after securing a $3 per-ton-of-coal price increase from Chalco. Chalco reportedly agreed to pay $56 per ton and ETT reportedly agreed to supply 5 to 6 million tons of coal to Chalco by the end of 2013.

According to the Uganda Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development's Report on Public Debt, Grants, Guarantees and Other Financial Liabilities for Financial Year 2021/2022, as of December 31, 2021, total loan disbursements amounted to $349,999,999.99 and the loan’s amount outstanding (including arrears) was $282,692,309.99. The 51 km expressway project was expected to cost $476 million, with $126 million of the funding coming from the Government of Uganda.   China Communications Construction Company, Ltd. (CCCC) was the contractor responsible for implementation of the project. The project was supervised by Beijing Expressway Supervision Company. The purpose of the project was to construct a toll road from Entebbe Airport to the country’s capital, Kampala. It was part of Government of Uganda’s overall strategy for decongesting Kampala through construction of an inner beltway comprising the Kampala Northern and Southern Bypasses as well as an outer beltway along the edges of the Great Kampala Metropolitan Area. It also aimed to enhance trade and movement between the two cities. The four-lane highway also features at least four toll stations and four interchanges with overpasses, along with a connection to the new highway to Munyonyo, Uganda’s major international conference destination. The link between the new highway and Munyonyo includes a 3 km, two-lane bridge constructed to run over a Nile River marshland that cuts across the proposed road link.   Construction was originally expected to begin around July 2012, with the project taking three years to complete (July 2015). On November 21, 2012, President Yoweri Museveni Wednesday officially launched the project at a groundbreaking ceremony in Kyengera. The project was ultimately completed on June 15, 2018. However, it has reportedly underperformed vis-a-vis its original objectives. Seventeen months after the completion of the project, the tolling system for the expressway was still not operational. Traffic levels were low, which cast doubt on whether the Government of Uganda would generate enough toll revenue to meet its principal and interest repayment obligations under the China Eximbank PBC loan.   Also, as of April 2019, the Government of Uganda had still not passed a law to allow for tolling on the road. But its first loan repayment to China Eximbank was due on May 22, 2019. As of 2021, a company had just been contracted to manage the toll collection process, the expressway remained underutilized, and tolls were still not being collected. While some trips from Kampala to Entebbe have seen significant reductions in travel time, the 51 km expressway has reportedly failed to alleviate the main traffic bottlenecks that affect most trips from the city center. The new expressway does not reach downtown – it only connects to the Northern Bypass which is also difficult to reach from downtown during the peak traffic period. It does, however, provide a good connection between the international airport, the President’s Palace in Entebbe, and the Munyonyo Resort on the lake where President Museveni entertains foreign dignitaries. According to ITDP Africa, which did an analysis of the traffic problem on the old Entebbe-Kampala highway, the traffic bottleneck was almost entirely caused by a few saturated roundabouts and double-parked vehicles at a critical market. ITDP Africa concluded that ‘it was clearly not necessary to spend $475 million’ on the construction of a new expressway.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company",430458063.469447,"The 51 kilometer highway starts at Entebbe International Airport and continues to Mpala, goes through Akright City, Kajjansi, and Kabojja, and ends at Busega, where it joins the Kampala Northern Bypass Highway, a distance of approximately 37.23 kilometers (23 mi).

(TBEA).   According to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the first loan disbursement (of $115,800,000) took place on December 31, 2014. The same source notes that, as of 2014, the loan disbursement rate was 30% ($115,800,000 out of $386,000,000). According to internal data that the Kyrgyz Ministry of Finance shared with AidData in July 2022, this loan achieved a disbursement rate of 100% as of December 31, 2021 and its amount outstanding was $389,924,333.33 as of December 31, 2021.   The project sought to install two turbines (units 12 and 13) with a capacity of 150 megawatts at the Bishkek Thermal Power Plant (TPP). As a result, the capacity of Bishkek TPP was expected to increase by 125 megawatts. Prior to project completion, the annual output of electricity at the TPP was one billion kWh. After its modernization through the China Eximbank-financed project, the production of the TPP was expected to reach 1.8 billion kWh. Heat production was also expected to increase from two million gigacalories to three million gigacalories per year.   TBEA was the contractor responsible for implementation. Project implementation commenced on April 26, 2014 and the project was completed on August 30, 2017.   However, the Bishkek Therman Power Plant Modernization Project was plagued by controversy. Major failures occurred within 5 months of the power plant being put into operation.  Some boilers collapsed, causing power outages and stopping heating. In 2015, the Chamber of Audits, a state body tasked with overseeing government spending, issued a report questioning why the TBEA contract was not put out to tender when other companies were interested in bidding. Auditors also found that no technical feasibility study was undertaken to evaluate the needs and costs of the project. Nurlan Omurkul, who was chief of the Bishkek TPP, said that he had harbored strong doubts about hiring a company with no track record of building power stations, but that he had been badgered by senior Kyrgyz officials to endorse a decision that he said had obviously already been made. He told the New York Times that ‘I’ve worked my whole life in power and heating plants and knew all along that the Chinese price of $386 million was too expensive.’ Another Chinese company, China Machinery Engineering Corporation, offered a lower bid, $356 million, according to a parliamentary commission. But the Chinese Embassy reportedly insisted that its offer be dismissed. Eventually, the country’s former Prime Minister (Jantoro Satybaldiev), former mayor of Bishkek (Kubanychbek Kulmatov), and former Energy Minister (Osmonbek Artykbaev) were arrested on corruption charges and accused of using their positions to lobby for the interests of a Chinese company (TBEA) in the selection process of the contractor for the project.

The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, an 8 year grace period, a 2% interest rate,  and 0.75% commitment fee.   According to Government of the DRC's Aid Management Platform (AMP), the loan had disbursed $91,046,040.07 as of July 2019. The loan's (principal) amount outstanding was $360,000,000 in 2021 and 2022.   The project involved the construction of the Zongo II hydroelectric dam and the construction of a 220 kV transmission line from the dam to Kinsuka. The dam was expected to produce 150 megawatts per annum and create 2,000 jobs during its three-year construction phase.   Sinohydro and Societe Nationale d'Electricite (SNEL) were jointly responsible for project implementation. Construction began on May 16, 2012 and the project was officially completed on June 22, 2018.

The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial (EPC) contract (worth more than $400 million) between Électricité du Laos (EDL) — the state corporation of Laos that owns and operates the country's electricity generation, electricity transmission and electricity distribution assets — and China National Heavy Machinery Corporation (CHMC), which was signed on January 22, 2014.   The project involved the construction of a 72 km, 500kV high voltage power transmission line from Salavan to Sekong, the construction of two 500kV transformer substations, the construction of control rooms, the installation of transmission towers, and the installation of safety systems.   CHMC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. However, Pinggao Group Co., Ltd. (平高集团有限公司) — a subsidiary of the State Grid Corporation of China — was also involved in implementation (most likely as a subcontractor). According to a report published by the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the project commenced during the first half of 2018. The project was completed and the transmission lines and substations were put into operation on March 16, 2020.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the 500KV Salavan–Sekong II Electricity Transmission Line Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. Laos’ gross foreign exchange reserves were dangerously low between 2019 and 2021, hovering between 1.4 and 2.3 months of import cover, and total public and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) debt increased from 68 percent of GDP ($12.5 billion) in 2019 to 88 percent in 2021 of GDP (or $14.5 billion). According to a report published by the World Bank in April 2022, ‘[t]he energy sector, mostly represented by Électricité du Laos (EDL), accounted for over 30 percent of total PPG debt in 2021. […] EDL’s debt service obligations [were] still unsustainable [at the time], with future debt service accounting for about two fifths of EDL’s total operating revenue.’ The Laotian authorities sought and secured debt service payment deferrals from their Chinese creditors in 2020 and 2021; according to the World Bank, ‘[d]ebt service deferrals granted by major lenders in 2020-2021 amounted around 3.6 percent of GDP in 2021’ and ’[a]s a result, actual debt service payments are estimated to have declined to 48 percent of total revenues in 2021, compared to 65 percent in the 2021 [Government of Laos] plan.’  The country’s central bank (Bank of the Lao P.D.R) also made a $300 million drawdown under its currency swap agreement with the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) in June 2020 — when its gross reserves stood at only 1.5 months of import cover and credit rating agencies warned of a high default probability. Then, in 2021, the short-term emergency loan from the PBOC was ‘rolled over’ for another year. Around the same time, a Chinese state-owned enterprise purchased a major public infrastructure asset in Laos—a large part of the country’s electricity transmission grid—from EDL as part of an apparent debt-for-equity swap. China Southern Power Grid Co. and EDL established a joint venture known as Électricité du Laos Transmission Company Limited (EDLT) in September 2020.  China Southern Power Grid Co. purchased a 90% ownership stake in EDLT in exchange for a $600 million fee (equity infusion). Then, in March 2021, EDLT signed a 25-year concession agreement, which made it responsible for management of the country’s high-voltage transmission network above 230 kilovolts. Independent observers suggested at the time that EDL would likely use the $600 million upfront payment from China Southern Power Grid Co. to service its outstanding debts to Chinese creditors, although this has not been independently confirmed. According to the World Bank’s International Debt Statistics, the Government of Laos was responsible for making average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $232 million between 2019 and 2019 and average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth $60 million between 2020 and 2021 (a substantially lower figure due to payment deferrals); however, it expected to make average annual debt service payments to Chinese creditors worth nearly $678 million over the next seven years (2022-2028).","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient State-owned Company",445163299.651142,"The project involves the construction of a 72 km, 500kV high voltage power transmission line from Salavan to Sekong, the construction of two 500kV transformer substations, the construction of control rooms, the installation of transmission towers, and the installation of safety systems.

Borrowings through the line of credit were to be used for the development of infrastructure and resource projects in Kazakhstan. Then, on October 13, 2009, KAZ Minerals PLC (also known as ‘Kazakhmys Corporation LLC’ and ‘Kazakhmys’) announced that it was in discussions with CDB and Samruk-Kazyna regarding a major unsecured loan facility. Following a memorandum of financial cooperation that was signed by Kazakhmys, Samruk-Kazyna and CDB on November 14, 2009, $2.7 billion from the $3 billion line of credit was allocated to various projects of KAZ Minerals PLC. Then, on December 30, 2009, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC (also known as Kazakhmys Finance PLC) — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of KAZ Minerals PLC — and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $2 billion facility (loan) agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project. On the same day, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $100 million facility (loan) agreement for the Bozymchak Copper and Gold Mine Development Project. Thirteen days later, on January 12, 2010, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project. Then, on June 11, 2012, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed two additional loan agreements: a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All five loan agreements (collectively worth $2.7 billion) were financed by Samruk-Kazyna via borrowings from the $3 billion CDB line of credit.  All of the loans carried the following borrowing terms: maturities of between 12 and 15 years (with final maturity dates falling between January 2022 and August 2025), 3 year grace periods (with the first loan repayment scheduled for January 2013), annual interest rates of LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin, and 1.5% management fees. A separate fee of $3 million was also payable under the loan agreements for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Project and the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All of the loans were also backed by repayment guarantees from KAZ Minerals PLC and a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna. All five loans reportedly disbursed in full by January 2013. The remaining $300 million under the $3 billion CDB line of credit was utilized (drawn down) by Samruk-Kazyna for an unknown purposes and fully repaid in January 2013. In January 2014, KAZ Minerals PLC fully repaid its loans for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project (since the development of these projects was no longer expected to commence in the near future). Then, on December 29, 2014, two of the loan agreements that KAZ Minerals Finance PLC had previously signed with Samruk-Kazyna (via on-lending from the CDB line of credit) were transformed into bilateral loan agreements with CDB: the loan agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project and the loan agreement for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project. At that time, the face value of the loan for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project was $1,844,000,000 (most likely because some repayments were made between January 2013 and December 2014) and the face value of the loan for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project was upsized to $148,500,000 (for an unknown reason). At that time the borrowing, terms of the two loans with outstanding balances were rescheduled.  The interest rate was lowered from LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin to LIBOR plus a 4.50% margin; and an arrangement fee of 0.5% was agreed upon, of which 60% was paid in December 2014 and 40% was paid in January 2016. The maturities and grace periods of the loan were left unchanged. KAZ Minerals PLC continued to serve as a guarantor for the loans. However, as an additional credit enhancement, the borrower pledged a $100,000,000 minimum cash balance in a charge account (collection account) as a source of collateral. The amended, bilateral loan (facility) agreements between CDB and KAZ Minerals also clarified that the loan proceeds were to be used by the borrower ‘principally for the development of the Bozshakol and Bozymchak [mine] projects.’ As of December 31, 2020, $1.0 billion was drawn down by the borrower under the $1,844,000,000 CDB loan agreement and the $148,500,000 CDB loan agreement.

Then, on December 30, 2011, Public Joint-Stock Company Territorial Generating Company No. 2 (JSC ‘TGK-2’ or TGK-2) and China Huadian Hong Kong Co., Ltd. created a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and joint venture called Limited Liability Company ‘Huadian-Teninskaya Combined Cycle Power Plant’. JSC ‘TGK-2’ holds a 51% ownership stake and China Huadian Hong Kong Co., Ltd. holds a 49% ownership stake in the SPV. The purpose of the SPV was to procure, construct, install, and operate a new gas-fired combined-cycle co-generation power plant with a capacity of 482 MW in Yaroslav Oblast.  The total cost of the 482MW Teninskaya Gas Steam Combined Cycle Power Project was $571 million and it was financed according to 70:30 debt-to-equity ratio. On January 18, 2013, ICBC and Limited Liability Company ""Huadian-Teninskaya Combined Cycle Power Plant"" signed a $399,777,000 (approximately 14 billion rubles) facility agreement for the 482MW Teninskaya Gas Steam Combined Cycle Power Project. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: an 11 year maturity, a 2.5 year grace period, an interest of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3.95 margin (4.11% as of January 2013), and a commitment fee of 0.8%. The parties agreed that repayments would be made in 19, semi-annual installments of $28,555,500 between June 1, 2015 and December 1, 2023. The proceeds of the loan were used to finance the procurement, construction, installation, and operation of a new gas-fired combined-cycle co-generation power plant with a capacity of 482 MW in Yaroslav Oblast. JSC “TGK-2” pledged its 51% ownership stake as as a source of collateral to ICBC. The borrower also purchase credit insurance from Sinosure.   The first tranche of the loan (worth 4.5 billion rubles) was disbursed on December 30, 2013. The second tranche (worth 1.88 billion billion rubles) was disbursed on September 15, 2014. The third tranche (worth 5.76 billion rubles) was disbursed on January 20, 2016. JSC ‘TGK-2’ and China Huadian Hong Kong Co., Ltd. were jointly responsible for implementation. A foundation-laying ceremony took place on September 7, 2011. Construction began on June 18, 2012. The launch of the power plant was originally planned for 2014. However, the local authorities agreed to postpone its commissioning until December 31, 2016.

This project is also known as Phase 1 of the Alternative North-South Road Project (or “Строительство альтернативной автомобильной дороги Север-Юг, фаза 1”). The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, an 11 year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.18% management fee, and a 0.25% commitment fee. The proceeds from the loan were used to support a July 8, 2013 commercial contract worth $399,989,041 between the Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic and China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC).   According to the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the first loan disbursement (of $99,997,300) took place on December 31, 2014. The same source notes that the loan’s overall disbursement rate, as of 2014, was 25% ($99,997,300 out of $399,989,041). According to internal data that the Kyrgyz Ministry of Finance shared with AidData in July 2022, this loan achieved a disbursement rate of 75% ($299,991,780.75 of $399,989,041) as of December 31, 2021 and its amount outstanding was $303,058,363.40 as of December 31, 2021.  The purpose of the project was to construct the Kazarman-Jalal Abad (km291-km433) section and Balykchy-Aral (km183+500-km195+486) section of the Alternative North-South Road. More specifically, it supported the construction of two road segments: one that runs from Kazarman village to Jalal Abad town (km291-km433) and another than runs from Balykchy (Kyzyl-Zhyldyz) village to Aral village (km183+500-195+486).  The ultimate aim of this international North-South transport corridor is to reduce trade costs and connect Russia, Central Asia, Iran, and India.   CRBC was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on May 2, 2014. The project was originally scheduled for completion in December 2018. However, as of December 2020, it had still only achieved a 70% completion rate. The project was ultimately completed on November 10, 2021. It passed China Eximbank's final inspection in November 2022.  The are some indications that the preferential buyer's credit for the Kazarman-Jalal Abad Section and Balykchy-Aral Section of Alternative North-South Road Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.

The Alternative North-South Road Project has also been plagued by controversy and corruption allegations. According to a 2018 investigation, former Minister of Transport and Communications Kalykbek Sultanov and the Minister of Transport and Communications at the time (Zhamshitbek Kalilov) may have colluded with the contractor responsible for project implementation (CRBC) to embezzle funds that were allocated for the Alternative North-South Road by China Eximbank. The investigation found the project input costs were inflated by several orders of magnitude — from paying $1.1 per kilogram of cement (while the cost on the local market was $0.07) to paying $2,000 a month to provide office space to an engineer on the construction site.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company",451202258.723358,"The project supported the construction of two road segments: one that runs from Kazarman village to Jalal Abad town (km291-km433) and another than runs from Balykchy (Kyzyl-Zhyldyz) village to Aral village (km183+500-195+486).

Then, in October 2009, Premier Wen Jiabao visited North Korea to make the deal official and the Chinese Government agreed to take on the bridge construction costs.  Then, on February 25, 2010, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of North Korea signed the Agreement between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea on Joint Construction, Management and Maintenance of the Yalu River Boundary Highway Bridge in Dandong City, Liaoning Province (中朝鸭绿江界河公路大桥 in Chinese). The initial estimated project cost was RMB 1.98 billion, but this figure later increased to RMB 2.22 billion.   The purpose of the project is to construct a new (river) road bridge across the Amnok River between Dandong, Liaoning Province, China, and Sinuiju, North Korea. The cable-stayed bridge, which is 3 kilometers (1.9 miles) long including the supporting roads, is intended as a replacement for the Sino–Korean Friendship Bridge. When the bridge is completed, the existing Amnok River Bridge (located approximately 10km away from the new bridge) will be restricted to railroad traffic only, and general road traffic to-and-from North Korea and China will be rerouted to the new bridge. The existing Amnok River Bridge (‘Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge’) has been cited as a bottleneck for the blooming trade industry between North Korea and China for several reasons. The bridge, built in 1911, accommodates both a railway and roadway, but has only one lane. Furthermore, its old age has sparked safety concerns; trucks weighing over 20 tons have been prohibited from using the bridge.  CCCC Second Harbor Engineering Co., Ltd. is the contractor responsible for implementation.   A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on December 31, 2010 and main bridge closure was achieved in 2013. However, the project reportedly ‘stalled’ between 2014 and 2019. On October 31, 2014, the Chinese state-run Global Times media outlet reported that the North Korean Government had not honored its commitment to construct access roads to the bridge and as such, the project was indefinitely on hold. However, when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited North Korea in June 2019, he reportedly promised to bear the full cost of constructing roads and customs posts on the North Korean side of the bridge. Then, in September 2019, Kim Jong-un issued ""Order No. 1”, which called for the completion and opening of the bridge. By the end of the month, construction of access roads and customs posts on the North Korean side of the bridge began. Then, at the end of January 2020, North Korea blocked the border between China and North Korea and evacuated all construction personnel due to the spread of COVID-19. By April 2020 the project was reportedly nearing completion. However, in mid-August 2020, the project was stopped again. Then, in October 2020, project implementation re-commenced.

The agreement was signed by Gabonese Finance Minister Paul Toungui and China's ambassador Hxue Jinwei. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 3% interest rate.  Also, on May 24, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Gabon also signed a USD-denominated preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement worth $300 million for the 160MW Grand Poubara Hydroelectric Dam Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. The proceeds from the GCL and the PBC were used to finance approximately $370 million of a $398 million Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contract with Sinohydro. The Government of Gabon covered the remaining $28 million cost of the EPC contract.  The Government of Gabon also issued sovereign guarantees for the two loans from China Eximbank.  Project ID#85 captures the GCL, while Project ID#73173 captures the PBC.   The project involved the construction of a dam on the Ogooué river with 4 Francis turbines capable of generating 160 MW. The dam was built in part to generate power for an iron ore mine in Belinga (see Project ID#630).  The project also involved the construction of two power transmission lines: a 15 km line from the dam site to Franceville, the country's third largest city, and another line from the dam site to Moanda (the largest manganese mining region in Gabon and in the world).  The dam is located 15 km outside of Franceville in the province of Haut-Ogooué, more than 700 km southwest of Libreville, an area where the Compagnie minière de l’Ogooué’s (COMILOG) main manganese mine is located.   Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for implementation. Construction officially began on November 15, 2008, and it was originally anticipated that the construction process will be completed in 54 months (May 15, 2013).   The dam was impounded on April 30, 2013.  Then, the four power generating units went into operation on August 5, 2013. The dam, water diversion system and other civil works passed final inspection by the project owner on July 22, 2014. The power generator set and auxiliary equipment also passed final inspection by the project owner on August 9, 2014, effectively marking the completion of the project.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loans for the 160MW Grand Poubara Hydroelectric Dam Construction Project  may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender.  In mid-2014, a decline in international oil prices generated sharp reductions in Gabon’s oil exports and fiscal revenues. The country’s rising fiscal deficit led to the accumulation of arrears to external creditors. By 2017, the stock of the Government of Gabon’s external arrears stood at $115 million, including arrears to China, Canada, Germany, Spain, France, Israel, and South Korea. All of these arrears were successfully cleared by 2020. However, the Government of Gabon accumulated $3 million of additional arrears to Chinese creditors in 2020.  By the end of May 2021, ‘the stock of [the Government of] Gabon’s external arrears stood at CFAF 98.03 billion (US$182.1 million), including CFAF 23.8 billion (US$44.2 million) vis-à-vis multilaterals and CFAF 21.05 billion (US$39.1 million) vis-à-vis government agencies and private creditors insured with companies from Paris Club member countries and from China [ICBC and China Construction Bank] CFAF 1.3 billion (US$2.42 million). The Government's strategy for the clearance of existing external arrears consists of focusing primarily on multilateral debt, bilateral debt, insured commercial commitments and seeking agreements with other creditors prior to the IMF Board meeting. Accordingly, we will clear the arrears vis-à-vis the multilaterals. We will also clear bilateral and commercial-insured arrears as follows: (i) Austria CFAF 6.83 billion (US$12.69 million); (ii) France CFAF 11.9 billion (US$22.11 million); (iii) Israel CFAF 2.23 billion (US$4.13 million); and Spain CFAF 0.09 billion (US$0.17 million).

30801,"China (People's Republic of)","Ghana","Africa",2008,2016,"China Eximbank provides RMB 2.1 billion government concessional loan for Bui Dam Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#183, #30709, #30086, #95483, #95484)","On September 25, 2007, China Eximbank and the Government of Ghana signed a buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement worth $293,506,062 for the Bui Dam Construction Project. Then, on September 3, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Ghana signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth RMB 2.1 billion ($330 million). The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 17.2 year-maturity (final maturity date: November 21, 2025), a 5-year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2013), an interest rate of CIRR plus a margin of 0.75% (6.13%), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity (final maturity date: September 3, 2028), a 7 year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2015), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL is captured via Project ID#30801 and the BCL is captured via Project ID#183. The BCL was collateralized with (a) net revenue from a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between Bui Power Authority — an organization with a mandate to plan, execute and manage the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant Project — and the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) for the purchase of the energy to be generated from the Bui hydroelectric power plant, and (b) receivables from Ghana Cocoa Board’s sale of up to 30,000 tons of main crop cocoa and 10,000 tons of light crop cocoa per annum to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing under a 20-year, Cocoa Sales Agreement (CSA); and (c) and a mortgage of the land and building and equipment and machinery of the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant. The cocoa beans were sold at the prevailing market price rather than a fixed price, and the proceeds were to be placed in a Government of Ghana bank account to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). Then, once the dam was operational (and the cocoa agreement came to an end), 85% of the proceeds from sales of energy generated by the Bui hydroelectric power plant were to be placed in an escrow account held by China Eximbank to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). The borrower was expected to maintain a minimum cash balance in the escrow account. The escrow account balance was $27,275,000 in 2018 and $25,582,000 in 2019. The Government of Ghana bank account (for the cash proceeds from COCOBOD’s sale of cocoa to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing) had a balance of $167,816,000 in 2018 and $209,783,000 in 2019. The GCL, by contrast, was not collateralized; it was backed by the full faith and credit of the Government of Ghana. The borrower also purchased a buyer’s credit insurance policy from Sinosure at a cost of $25 million for the BCL (i.e. 8.5% of the face value of the BCL).  According to the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS), the $293,506,062 loan (BCL) and the $330,000,000 loan (GCL) jointly achieved a 81.2% average disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 30 loan disbursements (worth $505,088,349.00) between 2009 and 2012: a $57,786,692.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #1) on May 15, 2009, a $35,217,544.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #2) on February 27, 2009, a $10,896,807.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #3) on October 26, 2009, a $27,469,679.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #4) on December 15, 2009, a $6,865,488.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #5) on January 18, 2010, a $9,390,036.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #6) on February 25, 2010, a $13,754,282.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #7) on May 9, 2010, a $18,208,899.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #8) on July 23, 2010, a $6,755,424.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #9) on July 23, 2010, a $8,919,668.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #10) on August 18, 2010, a $7,321,959.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #11) on September 20, 2010, a $6,563,979.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #12) on December 10, 2010, a $5,515,930.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #13) on December 6, 2010, a $107,904,311.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #14) on December 30, 2010, a $12,367,797.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #15) on February 28, 2011, a $8,689,838.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #16) on March 18, 2011, a $7,321,338.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #17) on April 28, 2011, a $6,870,418.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #18) on June 7, 2011, a $6,957,804.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #19) on July 22, 2011, a $16,330,457.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #20) on September 13, 2011, a $4,248,349.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #21) on October 31, 2011, a $4,071,390.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #22) on November 30, 2011, a $19,056,526.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #23) on December 28, 2011, a $5,071,871.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #24) on April 12, 2012, a $6,955,729.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #25) on April 12, 2012, a $14,889,380.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #26) on May 18, 2012, a $4,807,999.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #27) on June 22, 2012, a $48,355,586.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #28) on July 31, 2012, a $13,242,808.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #29) on October 12, 2012, and a $3,280,361.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #30) on November 30, 2012.  Two additional loans from China Eximbank were negotiated on April 30, 2012 to pay for cost overruns on the dam (the so-called ‘Supplementary Bui Hydroelectric Dam Project’): a $75.4 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) with a maturity of 20 years (final maturity date: April 30, 2032), a 5 year grace period (first repayment date: April 30, 2017), and a 2% interest rate and a $76,206,939 buyer’s credit loan (BCL) with a maturity of 13.5 years (final maturity date: November 21, 2025), a 2 year grace period (first repayment date: April 30, 2014), and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.731% in April 2012) plus a 4% margin. The $75.4 million PBC is captured via Project ID#30086 and the $76,206,939 BCL is captured via Project ID#30709. According to the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS), the $75.4 million PBC and the $76,206,939 BCL jointly achieved a 54.7% average disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 8 loan disbursements (worth $82,949,965.55) between 2014 and 2017: a $18,800,258.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #39) on April 9, 2014, a $8,065,407.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #35) on December 19, 2014, a $1,538,389.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #36) on December 31, 2014, a $3,649,254.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #37) on December 31, 2014, a $6,937,499.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #38) on April 9, 2015, a $14,815,581.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #40) on July 16, 2015, a $12,775,468.25 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #41) on March 11, 2016, and a $16,368,109.30 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #42) on January 25, 2017.  The 2008 GCL's (principal) amount outstanding was $297,615,000 in 2018, $301,237,000 in 2019, GHS 926,830,000 ($165,505,357) in 2020, and GHS 889,400,000 ($171,038,461) in 2021.

The 2007 BCL’s amount outstanding was $166,166,000 in 2018, $143,051,000 in 2019, GHS 621,650,000 ($111,008,928) in 2020, and GHS 618,100,000 ($118,865,384) in 2021. The 2012 BCL’s amount outstanding was $41,348,000 in 2018, $37,137,000 in 2019, GHS 269,920,000 ($48,200,000) in 2020, and GHS 274,000,000 ($52,692,307) in 2021.  The 2008 GCL's amount outstanding was $297,615,000 in 2018 and $301,237,000 in 2019. The 2012 PBC's amount outstanding was $78,582,000 in 2018 and $78,583,000 in 2019. The 2007 BCL’s amount outstanding was $166,166,000 in 2018 and $143,051,000 in 2019. The 2012 BCL’s amount outstanding was $41,348,000 in 2018 and $37,137,000 in 2019.  The GCL and PBC were eventually rescheduled such that repayments would commence on July 15, 2023 and end on July 15, 2037, which implies a maturity extension of 8.8 years and a grace period extension of 7.8 years for the GCL and a maturity extension of 5.2 years and a grace period extension of 6.2 years for the PBC. The 2% interest rate that originally applied to both the GCL and PBC also increased to 2.7% as part of the rescheduling. The GCL rescheduling is captured via Project ID#95483. The PBC rescheduling is captured via Project ID#95484.  The Bui Dam Construction Project had six components: (1) a roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) gravity dam incorporating a 5-bay spillway; (2) three penstocks in the middle of the dam; (3) a powerhouse at the toe of the dam on the left bank; (4) two rock fill saddle dams on the right bank; (5) a switchyard; and (6) 276 km of transmission lines; and a permanent bridge downstream of the dam.   Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by Bui Power Authority. The dam was designed by the French engineering firm Coyne et Bellier, which also served as the consulting engineers on the project. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on August 24, 2007. However, construction did not begin until December 2, 2008. Then, on May 3, 2013, the first generator was inaugurated. The dam was inaugurated on December 19, 2013. However, the project was not completed and handed over to the Ghanaian authorities until November 28, 2016.   There are many indications that the China Eximbank loans for the Bui Dam Construction Project have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. First, in August 2017, the Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod) — a state-owned company whose export receipts provide an important source of revenue for loan repayment to China Eximbank — told the country’s parliament it was in financial distress due to its loan repayment obligations related to the construction of the Bui Dam. Second, at least two of the four loans were rescheduled. Third, in April 2023, Samuel Kofi Dzamesi, the Chief Executive Officer of BPA revealed that the ECG had accumulated $612 million of payment arrears (overdue payments) to BPA. ECG’s payments to BPA for electricity purchases were originally intended to be the main source of revenue for repaying China Eximbank. Fourth, according to the World Bank’s International Development Statistics, the Government of Ghana had accumulated principal and interest arrears to one or more official sector Chinese creditors worth $908,337,346.70) in 2020 ($763,228,526.60 in principal arrears and $145,108,820.10 in interest arrears). Fifth, on December 19, 2022, the Government of Ghana announced a sovereign default, suspending debt service on its Eurobonds, its commercial loans, and most of its bilateral loans.","Completion","Development","Loan","ODA-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company",460658980.201156,"Bui Dam is located on the Black Volta river at the Bui Gorge, at the southern end of Bui National Park.

This loan carried a maturity of 9 years, a grace period of 1.5 years, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (1.18% in June 2009) + a 5.76% margin. The loan’s final maturity date was June 22, 2018.  Vnesheconombank used the proceeds of this loan to on-lend to a company called Open Joint Stock Company LSR Group (or LSR Group OJSC), which is a Russian real estate development, construction and building materials company and the largest developer and manufacturer of construction materials in Russia’s North-West Federal District. This on-lending agreement [Loan Agreement No.110100/1031] was signed on June 29, 2009.  The CDB loan was approved under a $1 billion framework agreement that VEB and China Development Bank signed in 2009 to support investment projects and activities by Chinese companies conducting business in the Russian Federation, including those related to timber processing, energy and construction (see Project ID#43036).   The total cost of the Slantsy Cement Plant Construction Project was EUR 442.2 million and it was supported by an additional EUR 107 million loan from ABN AMRO and HSBC. The purpose of the project was to construct a cement plant — in the city of Slantsy within Leningrad Oblast — with a production capacity of 1.86 million tons of cement per year. The plant uses state-of-the-art production lines manufactured by FLSmidth of Denmark, a world leader in cement manufacturing equipment. It uses the most efficient ‘dry’ technology, which also provides for partial use of oil shale waste in the cement production process that ensures over 40 percent of the energy required for production lines. The project site in Slantsy occupies an area of 40 hectares, excluding quarries, access roads and railways.   OOO Cement Northwest (or Cement North-West LLC), a wholly owned subsidiary of Hefei Cement Research and Design Institute, was the general contractor responsible for implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony of the plant took place on May 27, 2008. On November 27, 2010, LSR Group performed a ‘technological launch’ of the plant. Then, on July 14, 2011, the plant was officially commissioned. The final project acceptance certificate was signed by the project owner on July 19, 2012.

Canada-based Peru Copper Inc. originally owned 91% of shares and the remaining 9% were owned by unspecified firms. Shortly thereafter, all of the mining concessions in Toromocho were transferred to Chinalco's wholly-owned subsidiary, Minera Chinalco Peru S.A. (Chinalco Peru). Then, on December 1, 2010, China Eximbank and Minera Chinalco Perú S.A. ('Chinalco Peru') — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of Aluminum Corporation of China Limited (Chinalco) — signed a $2 billion overseas investment loan to finance capital expenditures related to the Toromocho Copper Mine Project (captured via Project #36064). The loan carried an interest rate 6-month LIBOR plus 185 basis points. However, its other borrowing terms are unknown. The parent company Chinalco entered into a guarantee agreement with China Eximbank for the entire outstanding amount, accrued interest, penalties and other expenses arising from the loan from China Eximbank. Chinalco was also required to pay a 1% commission for each drawdown. This overseas investment loan facility is secured by (i.e. collateralized against) all property, plant and equipment pertaining to the Toromocho Project if Chinalco’s credibility or financial status deteriorates. In March 2013, China Eximbank and Chinalco Peru signed a supplementary overseas investment loan (facility) agreement worth $419 million for additional capital expenditures related to the Toromocho Copper Mine Project (captured via Project #56098). The loan carried an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 350 basis points. The other borrowing terms are unknown. Chinalco Peru was required to pay a 1% commission fee for each drawdown and this second facility was also guaranteed by the parent company of Chinalco. The supplementary loan agreement was also collateralized against all property, plant and equipment pertaining to the Toromocho Mining Project if Chinalco’s credibility or financial status deteriorates. As of 2016, the entirety of this loan facility was drawn down.  The Toromocho Project is located in central Peru in the core of the Morococha mining district. It is one of the largest copper mines in the world, and the first greenfield copper mine developed by a Chinese corporation abroad. Upon completion, the project was expected to boost overall copper exports from Peru by 25%. CCCC Del Peru SAC (subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company, Ltd.) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. The Environmental Impact Assessment of the Toromocho Copper Mine Project was approved by the Peruvian government in December 2010. Chinalco Peru obtained the construction permit and began work in July 2011. The mines were officially commissioned on December 10, 2013. However, three months after its inauguration, the operation of the mine was suspended by Peru’s Environment Assessment and Enforcement Agency (OEFA) after it discovered illegal discharge of acid effluents in two nearby lakes. Chinalco quickly resolved this matter by building improved drainage and explained the incident as a result of unusually heavy rainfall which caused unexpected acid runoffs.

Then, on December 10, 2010, ICBC and Kimkano-Sutarsky Mining and Beneficiation Plant LLC (LLC KS GOK) — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and wholly-owned subsidiary of IRC Limited — signed a $340 million loan facility agreement for Phase 1 of the Kimkano & Sutarsky (K&S) Iron Mine Processing Plant Project. The loan, which is captured via Project ID#67153, carried the following borrowing terms: an 11.5 year maturity, a 4 year grace period, an insurance fee of 4.61% (of the face value of the loan), and an interest rate LIBOR plus a 2.8% margin. However, according to the 2018 Annual Report from Petropavlovsk (the largest shareholder of IRC Limited), the effective interest rate of this loan facility was 6.8% in 2018 and 6.41% in 2017. The loan facility was repayable semi-annually in 16 installments of $21,250,000, beginning in December 2014 and ending in June 2022 (the final maturity date). The loan was backed by a corporate repayment guarantee from Petropavlovsk PLC — the largest shareholder of IRC Limited — and a Sinosure credit insurance policy. It was also secured by (i.e. collateralized against) a minimum cash deposit in an ICBC-controlled escrow (security deposit) account. The borrower had deposited $6 million in the escrow (security deposit) account as of December 31, 2011, $6 million as of December 31, 2013, and $27,250,000 as of December 31, 2014. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of a $400 million (HK$3.11 billion) engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract that it signed with China National Electric Engineering Corporation on December 6, 2010.   On December 14, 2011, the LLC KS GOK made the first drawdown from the loan facility amounting to $6.9 million. As of December 31, 2014, IRC Limited had drawn down approximately $287,976,000 from the loan facility with another $52,024,000 left undrawn. On February 15, 2015, ICBC granted a conditional extension to the availability period of this undrawn amount by six months to June 8, 2015 and all relevant condition precedents were satisfied as of February 27, 2015. On December 14, 2011, the borrower made its first loan drawdown amounting to $6,958,000. During the first six months of 2012, the borrower made further drawdowns amounting to $75,519,000. Then, between December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2013, the borrower made further drawdowns amounting to $187,811,000. Additional drawdowns amounting to $93,207,000 were made by the borrower in 2014. The first installment of $21,250,000 was repaid in December 2014. As of December 31, 2014, the loan’s (principal) amount outstanding was $266,726,000.   There are signs that the ICBC loan underperformed vis-a-vis the lender’s original expectations. On February 27, 2017, ICBC agreed to restructure two repayment installments of the $340 million loan facility. These two rescheduled repayments of $21,250,000 were worth $42.5 million in total, and they were originally due for payment on June 20, 2017 and December 20, 2017. They were rescheduled evenly into five subsequent semi-annual repayment installments in June 20, 2018, December 20, 2018, June 20, 2019, December 20, 2019 and June 20, 2020. As a result, each of the repayment installments increased by $8.5 million to an amount equal to $29.75 million. The February 27, 2017 restructuring agreement is captured via Project ID#67157. Then, in June 2018, the loan’s corporate guarantor (Petropavlovsk PLC) announced that it would provide $29.75 million to IRC Limited to enable its wholly-owned subsidiary (LLC KS GOK) to meet a June 2018 repayment to ICBC. At the time, Petropavlovsk PLC also said that it was in ‘advanced’ talks with a major Russian bank to refinance the entire $340 million project loan. IRC Limited said n June 2018 that it LLC KS GOK was unable to meet payments to ICBC and that ‘if a missed repayment of the ICBC facility occurs, this would result in a default under the facility and would create broader problems for Petropavlovsk.’ Then, on December 18, 2018, IRC Limited entered into a facility agreement with Gazprombank (a Russian bank) worth $240 million in total. The loan facility had a maturity of March 2026 and consisted of two tranches. The principal under the first tranche amounted to $160 million with interest being charged at LIBOR plus a 5.7% margin per annum it was repayable in equal quarterly payments during the term of the Gazprombank Facility (with the final payment scheduled for December 2026). The principal under the second tranche amounted to $80 million with interest being charged at LIBOR plus a 7.7% margin per annum and it was repayable in full at the end of the loan term (December 2026). In March 2019, IRC Limited drew down $228.9 million in total from the Gazprombank Facility to fully repay the amounts outstanding under the ICBC facility (worth approximately $169 million) and the loans provided by Petropavlosk Plc (worth approximately $57 million). The remaining loan proceeds were to finance the K&S Iron Mine Processing Plant Project’s working capital needs of approximately $3 million.   The K&S Mine, 100% owned by IRC Limited, is located in the Jewish Autonomous Region (EAO) of the Russian Far East. It is the second full-scale mining and processing operation that IRC Limited has developed. K&S enjoys a geographical advantage. The Trans Siberian Railway is linked directly to the mine site, allowing or easy transport of products to customers in China. K&S is located in the Obluchenskoye District of the Jewish Autonomous Region (EAO) in the Russian Far East. The mining operation is 4 kilometers from the town of Izvestkovaya, through which the Trans Siberian Railway passes. It is also 130 kilometers from the federal highway connecting to the regional capital of Birobidzhan, and 300 kilometers from Khabarovsk, the principal city of the Russian Far East.

China Eximbank agreed to cover 82% of the total project cost, with the Government of Pakistan covering the remaining 18%. This 'mixed credit' arrangement produced four different financial commitments: two preferential buyer's credits (PBC), one government concessional loan (GCL), and one buyer's credit loan (BCL). On January 14, 2014, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed a $382,848,800 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2013) 50 TOTAL NO. (294)].

The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 8 year grace period (captured via Project ID#41918). This agreement was amended on October 8, 2019 [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (15) 18 TOTAL NO. (360) (A)], but the purpose of the amendment is unknown. Additionally, on December 18, 2015, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed a $2.25 billion buyer’s credit loan (BCL) [Government of Pakistan loan ID#BC-BLA201401 and BCL 2015212932] carrying a 6% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 8 year grace period (captured via Project ID#41917).  The Government of Pakistan on-lent some or all of the proceeds of the China Eximbank loans to Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) -- a federally funded independent governmental agency -- at a 15% interest rate. The Government of Pakistan also reportedly issued sovereign guarantees for all four China Eximbank loans that supported the project. In December 2015, the amounts outstanding under all four China Eximbank loans (worth $5.668 billion) were reportedly transferred by the Government of Pakistan to PAEC (as the direct borrower).   The purpose of the project was to construct units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP), which is located in Paradise Point in Karachi within Sindh Province.  China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. It is using Hualon One technology (the CNNC's third-generation nuclear reactor design) to construct Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on November 26, 2013. Then, a major milestone was reached at the K-2 reactor when so-called ‘cold functional tests’ began on November 26, 2019. Cold functional tests are carried out to confirm whether the main system and its supporting facilities are properly installed and ready to operate under high-pressure conditions. K-2 was ultimately connected to the national grid on March 18, 2021. It was officially inaugurated on May 21, 2021 and put into operation on May 24, 2021. The K-3 reactor came online on March 4, 2022. The project was originally expected to reach completion by the end of 2020.  There are some indications that the RMB 2.647 billion China Eximbank government concessional loan for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In May 2019, PAEC sought the Prime Minister's approval to have the interest rates of the China Eximbank loans for Units 2 and 3 of the KANUPP Project reset to their original levels (when they were first issued by China Eximbank). Local sources reported at the time that the electricity tariff determined by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) was set on the basis of actual electricity generation costs and on-lending at a 15% rate increased actual electricity generation costs by PKR 108 billion (necessitating an PKR 1.8/kWh increase in the tariff rate). However, it is unclear if the Prime Minister approved PAEC’s request. Then, on or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the RMB 2.647 billion government concessional loan agreement for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. Then, on November 19, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE1-030]. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between January 1, 2021 and June 30, 2021 under the RMB 2.647 billion government concessional loan agreement for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project.

Then, on November 14, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh signed an RMB 1,950,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement and a $405.8 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the Multi-Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project. The GCL carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a grace period of 5 years, and a 0.2% commitment fee. The PBC carries the following terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a grace period of 5 years, and a 0.2% commitment fee. Project ID#55046 captures the GCL, while Project ID#38342 captures the PBC. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the GCL and the PBC to finance a commercial contract between the Government of Bangladesh’s Ministry of Road Transport and Bridges and China Communication Construction Company (CCCC), which was signed in June 2015. The GCL had disbursed RMB 936,1890,000 as of June 30, 2018, RMB 1,557,869,000 as of June 30, 2019, RMB 1,950,000,000 as of June 30, 2020, and RMB 1,950,000,000 as of June 30, 2021.

The purpose of the project, which is also known as the Multilane Karnaphuli Tunnel Project, is to construct a 3.4-kilometer-long, 10 meter-wide tunnel under the Karnaphuli River near the Port of Chittagong. The total length of the proposed tunnel will be around 9.092 kilometers, including a 3.40-kilometer tunnel under the Karnaphuli River with an approach road of 4.89 kilometers alongside 740 meters of bridges linking the main port city, and western side of the Karnaphuli along with the eastern side of the river. Upon completion, the tunnel will connect the port of Chittagong to the industrial area of the city and thereby relieve pressure on the three existing bridges. The total area of the project is 382.03 acres. More than 360.64 acres of land were acquired for the construction of roads and installments of utility lines.  A total of 2,275 families are affected by this project, and 1,660 were given compensation. China Communication Construction Company (CCCC) is the general (EPC) contractor responsible for project implementation. On November 24, 2015, the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (Ecnec) approved the Multi-Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project. Construction began on February 24, 2017.  Two years later, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh officially inaugurated boring works on the tunnel on February 24, 2019. The project had achieved a 40% physical completion rate by May 2019, including the installation of over 150 meters of the first tunnel and much of the above-ground works. Then, on July 31, 2020, the project reached a key milestone with the completion of the first underwater, after a made-in-China super-diameter slurry-pressure-balance tunnel boring machine (TBM) broke through at the Karnaphuli River east bank working shaft.    The TBM, which is 94 meters long and weighs more than 2,200 tons, was developed by the Tianhe Mechanical Equipment Manufacturing Co. It was the first super-diameter slurry-pressure-balance TBM to be self-developed and exported by China. The TBM uses several self-developed technologies, such as an automatic mud water circulation system. As of October 2021, all boring-related work was completed — after the excavation of the second tube (from Anwara end of Chittagong to Patenga end) of the 3.315-km tunnel) — and the project had achieved a 73% physical completion rate. By November 2021, the project had achieved a 77.5% physical completion rate. On May 8, 2022, Harunur Rashid Chowdhury, Project Director of Karnaphuli Multilane Road Tunnel, sent a letter to the Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA). In it, he noted that Shanghai Port had remained closed since March 2022 due to Covid-19 and the Chinese Government’s zero-tolerance policy had affected project’s progress: ‘It may be noted that […] most of the goods and equipment are being manufactured/procured from Shanghai. Therefore, the closure of the Shanghai Port is causing a delay in shipments. […] The goods and equipment planned to arrive in March [2022] are still not able to reach Chittagong Port to date. Subsequent shipments will also get affected on this account.’ In the letter, Harunur Rashid Chowdhury also asked the BBA to take up the issue with the Economic Relations Division (ERD) and arrange an extension of the China Eximbank loan availability period by six months until May 6, 2023. On May 7, 2022, Li Zheng, the CCCC Project Manager of the Karnaphuli Tunnel Project Site Office, acknowledged in a letter to Harunur Rashid Chowdhury that the delay in shipments from Shanghai was the result of China’s ‘zero Covid’ measures. Then, in June 2022, BBA announced that two sub-contractors hired CCCC to complete two project components — a management software system for BBA and the service area (east) — had violated their contractual obligations. According to a letter from Harunur Rashid Chowdhury, Project Director of Karnaphuli Multilane Road Tunnel, to the BBA, ‘CCCC was instructed to undertake this work, but they employed sub-contractors to do so.  CCCC selected these sub-contractors and is responsible for any default of the sub-contractors. […] Unfortunately, CCCC has not effectively monitored or exercised control over both these sub-contractors.’ The Multi-Lane Road Tunnel under River Karnaphuli Project was originally expected to reach completion by the end of 2020. However, in 2018, the project’s expected completion date was pushed back to December 4, 2022.    Upon completion, the underwater tunnel is expected to reduce the time it takes to drive from Hittagong Shah Amanat International Airport to the Hittagong industrial park from four hours to 20 minutes.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company",479170469.491865,"The Karnaphuli River Tunnel is located near the port of Chittagong.

KNBEPCL is a project company and a wholly owned subsidiary of ZESCO Limited, Zambia’s state-owned power company. The China Eximbank loan to KNBEPCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 15 year maturity an interest rate of LIBOR plus 200 basis points. The loan’s amount outstanding was $268 million as of December 31, 2015, $240.9 million as of December 31, 2016, $214.2 million as of December 31, 2017, $214.2 million as of December 31, 2018, $160.62 million as of December 31, 2019, $133.848 million os of December 31, 2020, $120,464,052 as of June 30, 2021, and $100,002,768 (inclusive of $6,308,506 in interest arrears) as of June 30, 2022.    The loan was secured by (collateralized against) receivables from Copperbelt Energy Corporation and Chambeshi Mining Company. The proceeds from this loan were used to be used by the borrower to finance an EPC contract between Sinohydro and ZESCO Limited, which was signed on November 15, 2007. Development Bank of South Africa also provided a $105 million loan for the same project. This project involved an expansion of the power generation capacity of the Kariba North hydroelectric power station through the installation of two new generators. Construction began on November 5, 2008. However, the project encountered a number of problems and delays. In 2009, a fire broke out in one of the generators. Then, in November 2011, it was reported that project completion had been delayed a year due to 'financial constraints'.   The project was ultimately completed on August 21, 2014. An official completion ceremony took place on August 27, 2014. The 1.08GW Kariba North hydroelectric power station is located on the bank of Zambezi River at Kariba in the southern province of Zambia. It includes the Kariba North Bank (KNB) (720MW) power plant and the Kariba North Bank Extension (KNBE) (360MW) power plant. The KNB power plant was developed between 1969 and 1976 as part of the Central African Power Corporation’s (CAPC) development program. The KNBE power plant consists of two 180MW vertical-shaft Francis turbines with a rated discharge 227.6m3/s operating at a head of 89m for each single unit. It has two intake chambers for water at an elevation of 458m. The underground powerhouse is 24m wide and 51m in length. The power generated is transmitted through a 130 km long, 330kV transmission line from the KNBE power plant to the existing Kafue west substation. The power generated from KNBE is purchased by ZESCO Limited under a 20-year long-term power purchase agreement (PPA), which was approved by Zambia’s Energy Regulation Board (ERB) in April 2011.","Completion","Development","Loan","ODA-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient State-owned Company",480244565.413951,"360MW Kariba North Bank Hydropower Plant (also known as Kariba North hydroelectric power station) is located on the bank of Zambezi River at Kariba in the southern province of Zambia.

The estimated borrowing terms of the PBC are as follows: a 2.999% interest rate, a 5.721 year grace period, and a 14.6265 maturity. It is known that the borrower was to use the PBC proceeds to finance a commercial contract between the Hydroelectric Power Department (HPD) of Myanmar’s Ministry of Electricity and China National Electric Equipment Corporation (CNEEC), which was signed on March 24, 2004.   On the same day (March 24, 2004), a MOU was signed between Myanmar's Hydroelectric Power Department (HPD), CITIC, Sinohydro regarding the Hydraulic Steel Structure (Lot HSS-2) and Electromechanical Equipment (Lot EM-1) for the Yeywa Hydropower Plant Project. However, it is unclear if Lot HSS-2 and Lot EM-1 were financed by a separate loan.  Then on July 15, 2005, China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) Technology Co Ltd and Sinohydro Corporation Ltd signed contracts worth $125 million: CITIC agreed to supply $113.13 million worth of generators and transformers and Sinohydro agreed to provide $12.50 million worth of water-gate doors and pipelines. China Gezhouba Water and Power (Group) Co Ltd also signed a contract worth $46.32 million in August 2005 for the construction of a reinforced concrete dam with the supply of machinery equipment. A year later, on September 2, 2005, China National Heavy Machinery Corporation (CHMC) signed contracts with Myanmar's Hydroelectric Power Department (HPD) on the implementation of the Yeywa Hydropower Project. Under the contracts worth $45.84 million, CHMC agreed to supply 230 KV transmission lines and substations for the Yeywa Hydropower Project (as captured via Project ID#64085).   The purpose of the $700 million project was to construct a 790MW hydroelectric power plant on the Myitnge River in Yeywa village, Kyaukse Township, and Mandalay Region. The dam design comprises a 137 meters (449 ft) high RCC embankment gravity dam, built of 2,800,000 cubic meters (99,000,000 cu ft) of concrete. The dam includes an ungated spillway of reinforced conventional concrete cast after RCC placement, located in the central section of the dam for a design flood water discharge of 6,600 cubic meters per second (230,000 cu ft/s). The 448-foot (137 m) wide spillway consists of eight 56-foot (17 m) wide and 39-foot (12 m) high outlets. There is a 790 MW (4 × 197.5 MW) powerhouse at the toe of the dam on the south bank of the river. The power house containing the turbines and generators is 510 feet (160 m) long, 148 feet (45 m) wide and 197 feet (60 m) high. The power house and dam structures are designed to withstand earthquakes of up to eight on the Richter scale. The power generation facilities consist of four water intakes, each consisting of 22-foot (6.7 m) diameter and 492-foot (150 m) long high tensile steel pipe penstocks and four vertical axis Francis turbines and generator units and associated electro-mechanical and auxiliary equipment installed in an open air powerhouse. Four water intake towers were built as conventional reinforced concrete structures abutting the upstream (east) face of the RCC dam. There is one permanent 10-meter (33 ft) diameter, 450-meter (1,480 ft) long, diversion tunnel in the north river bank serving as a bottom outlet. This outlet tunnel enables reservoir drawdown and control during reservoir filling, maintenance of downstream riparian river flow during the impounding period and, together with the spillway, serves to redirect flood waters of the Myitnge river and maintain river flow during an emergency when all turbines are closed down. Two double circuit 230 kV transmission lines connect the main transformers located on the downstream side of the powerhouse to an open-air switchyard, located on the south river bank 550 meters (1,800 ft) downstream of the powerhouse.   The Yeywa Dam supplies electric power to the Meiktila Sub-Power Station through the 110 km (68 mi) long Yeywa-Meiktila 230 kV double power line link to the southwest and to the Bellin Substation through another 50 km (31 mi) long 230 kV double power line link in the west. The Bellin and the Meiktila Sub-Power Stations are linked to each other with 100 km long 23 kV double power lines.   CNEEC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. However, China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) Technology Co Ltd, Sinohydro Corporation Ltd, China National Heavy Machinery Corporation (CHMC), and China Gezhouba Water and Power (Group) Co Ltd were also involved in the implementation of the $700 million 790MW Yeywa Hydropower Plant (HPP) Project.

Then, on July 13, 2007, a joint venture called the CHEC-UEMC Consortium was formed by China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd (51% ownership stake) and UEMC (49% ownership stake) to implement the Penang Second Crossing Bridge Construction Project. UEMC is a subsidiary of UEM Group. On the same day, China Eximbank and Bank Pembangunan — a state-owned development bank in Malaysia — signed a memorandum of agreement (MOA) regarding a $800 million preferential buyer's credit (PBC) for the Second Penang Bridge Construction Project (captured via Project ID #34958). The specified borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: 20 year maturity and 3% interest rate. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to partially finance an EPC contract with the CHEC-UEMC Consortium. However, UEM and CHEC could not arrive at a shareholders agreement in July 2008 due to disagreements over the apportionment of jobs and costs. Then, on August 29, 2008, the Malaysian Government terminated its concession agreement with UEM Group Berhad. Jambatan Kedua Sdn Bhd (JKSB) -- a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned company of Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance Incorporated (MOF Inc.) -- was subsequently appointed as the concessionaire responsible for the Second Penang Bridge Construction Project.   In 2009, China Eximbank and JKSB signed a $330 million PBC agreement for the Second Penang Bridge Construction Project. Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan (PBC). China Eximbank waived the requirement that the borrower purchase buyer’s credit insurance from Sinosure. The borrower made repayments worth $11 million in 2016 and $22 million in 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the loan’s amount outstanding was $297 million. As of December 31, 2018, the loan’s amount outstanding was approximately $288 million (RM 1.2 billion).   The purpose of the project was to construct a 24 km (15 mi) dual carriageway toll bridge that connects Bandar Cassia (Batu Kawan) in Seberang Perai on mainland Peninsular Malaysia with Batu Maung on Penang Island. The bridge consists of precast segmental concrete marine viaducts in 55-meter (180-feet) span modules and a cast in-situ concrete cable-stayed bridge measuring 475 meters (1,558 feet). It is the second bridge to link the island to the mainland after the first Penang Bridge. It extends over 16.9 km (10.5 mi) of water, making it the longest bridge in Malaysia and the second longest in Southeast Asia.   China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd (CHEC) and UEM Builders were the main contractors responsible for implementation. Construction began on November 8, 2008 and the originally scheduled project completion date was November 8, 2013. As of December 2009, the project had achieved an 8.65% completion rate. It was 24% complete as of April 2010. On January 27, 2011, the construction of the main bridge pile foundation was completed. The project was 60.87% complete as of March 2012. The capping of the main tower took place on August 7, 2012. As of October 3, 2012, the project was 84% complete. The final closure of the cable stayed bridge at the main navigational span of the Penang Second Bridge was completed on April 20, 2013. Then, on April 30, 2013, Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak became the country’s first leader to use the Penang Second Bridge to cross from the island to the mainland to attend a function in Kepala Batas, Seberang Perai. Penang Second Bridge was officially completed and accepted by the project owner (JKSB) on September 15, 2013. It was opened to the traffic at 12.01 AM on March 2, 2014 and renamed the Sultan Abdul Halim Muadzam Shah Bridge.

The borrowing terms of the loan (PBC) were as follows: an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.6% margin, a 3 year grace period, and a 23 year maturity. The Government of Ethiopia provided a sovereign guarantee for the loan.   The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of a $475 million commercial contract [ID# ET/ERC/CREC/0901] between the ERC and China Railway Group Limited (CREC), which was signed on September 3, 2009. The ERC was responsible for directly funding the remaining 15% of the commercial contract cost ($71,250,000). Its direct contribution was payable in ETB as a down payment (with exchange rate applicable to the base date.   According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), this loan achieved a 42% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 6 loan disbursements (worth ETB 3,097,176.899) between 2014 and 2016: an ETB 327,586,207 disbursement on January 8, 2014, an ETB 905,511,811 disbursement on July 8, 2014, an ETB 680,000,000 disbursement on October 8, 2014, an ETB 989,898,990 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 544,700 disbursement on October 7, 2015, and an ETB 193,635,191 disbursement on April 7, 2016.   The Addis Ababa light rail metro system is a 31.6 km electrified light rail transportation system with two lines: a 17.4 kilometer east-west line and a 16.9 kilometer north-south line. The east-west line stretches from Ayat village to Tor Hailoch passing through Megenagna, Legehar and Mexico Square The north-south line passes through Menelik II Square, Merkato, Lideta, Leghar, Meskel Square, Gotera and Kaliti. The light rail metro system was designed to facilitate transportation in a city of 5 million clogged with other forms of transportation.  Each train was planned have a capacity to carry 286 passengers for a maximum capacity of 300,000 passengers/day. CREC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation.   The EPC contract identifies January 31, 2012 as the expected project commencement date and January 30, 2015 as the expected project completion date. It also identifies a defects liability period of one year. The project site was ultimately handed over to the EPC contractor on January 31, 2012. However, construction did not begin until April 2013. Trial operation of the railway began on February 1, 2015. The north-south line commenced operations on September 20, 2015, and the east-west line commenced operations on November 9, 2015.    According to official figures, the rail system carried on average 105,000-110,000 daily passengers during its first 14 months of operations. Tickets initially cost two to six birr ($0.08 to $0.20), depending on the distance of the trip. ERC earned $5 million in revenue from the light rail line during the Ethiopian Fiscal Year 2016/17, and by January 2017, the rail system had carried over 50 million customers. The rail system was initially supposed to be run by the Shenzhen Metro Group and CRECG until 2020. However, in 2018, the ERC was prepared to take over the operation of the railway from CRECG.   Since then, the railway has faced an array of operational performance and revenue generation problems. The Addis Ababa light rail metro system initially began operating with 40 trains, but as of 2021, it was regularly operating with approximately 20 trains. Addis Ababa’s deputy mayor has also noted that the city’s electrical grid lacked the capacity to power the system before construction began. Even with its own dedicated power supply, the Addis Ababa light rail metro system still experiences power outages and delays, leading to packed cars and poor service. Additionally, in 2021, Ethiopia’s Office of the Auditor General found that, during its first four years in operation, the Addis Ababa light rail metro system generated $11.1 million of revenue but cost $154 million to operate. It found that the system was falling far short of its original feasibility study, which said it would pay for its construction costs within 10 years through ticket sales, advertising and renting out spaces in stations, among other methods: '[t]he feasibility study has been inadequate, and it was conducted without collecting enough information. […] This, coupled with the absence of a maintenance center to fix the trains that need repair and other factors, have contributed to the losses sustained by the light railway.'  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Addis Ababa Light Rail Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Ethiopia’s Office of the Auditor General also found in 2021 that the ERC had fallen into arrears and paid $2.8 million in fines to China Eximbank for overdue loan repayments related to the Addis Ababa Light Rail Project. Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs.

Then, on September 29, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a second BCL agreement [ID# 2016211190] worth $576 million for the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project (captured via Project ID#54087). The borrowing terms of the 2016 BCL were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 8 year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2.8% margin, a 0.75% management fee, and a 0.5% commitment fee. Both BCLs were to be repaid and secured with cash (from surcharges on electricity) deposited in an escrow account known as the Neelum-Jhelum Hydro Power Development Fund. As of December 28, 2018, the cash balance of the escrow account was approximately $10,760,508 (PKR 1.49 billion).  The Government of Pakistan on-lent the proceeds of the BCLs (at a 12% interest rate) to Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Company (Pvt) Ltd (NJHPC), which is a project company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) that was created to design, construct, own, operate and maintain the Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Project. As of June 30 2017, the $576 million BCL had fully disbursed and the $448 million BCL had achieved a 42.6% disbursement rate ($191.067 million out of $448 million).  According to a March 2018 tariff petition that NJHPC submitted to Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), the total project cost of 506,579 million Pakistani rupees (PKR) was to be financed according to a debt-equity-grant ratio of 79:9:11. The total amount of debt financing amounted to PKR 401,416 million, which is roughly equivalent to $3.823 billion. Additional foreign sources of debt financing included $358 million from the Islamic Development Bank, $181 million from the Saudi Fund for Development, $81 million from the OPEC Fund for International Development, and $74 million from the Kuwait Fund for Arabic Economic Development.  The 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project is a run-of-the-river project in the State of Azad Jammu and Kashmir. The power plant has four power generation units and it was designed to divert the water from river Neelum through a tunnel. The tunnel intake is at Nauseri, 41 km northeast of Muzaffarabad and the underground powerhouse was constructed at Chatter Kalas, 22 km south of Muzaffarabad. The diverted water will produce electric power by passing through the turbines and thereafter this water will be released back into the River Jhelum, about 4 km south of ChatterKalas. Upon completion, the project was expected to produce 5.15 billion units of electricity annually.  The EPC contractor for this project was a Chinese consortium known as CGGC-CMEC that consisted of China Gezhouba Group Co., Ltd. (CGGC) and China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMEC). In January 2008, a letter of commencement was issued to the EPC contractor. The implementation of the project began on February 9, 2008 and construction activities were originally expected to reach completion by October 2016. According to WAPDA, 90% of the construction works were completed by March 2018. The project was officially completed on April 13, 2018. The Neelum-Jhelum power plant delivered 590 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity from unit three on July 4, 2018, 453 GWh from unit four on October 4, 2018, 331 GWh from unit two on August 27, 2018 and 314 GWh from unit one on December 28, 2018. The project was originally expected to achieve its commercial operations date (COD) by December 2018. However, it is unclear if the project achieved this goal. As of February 2021, Pakistan’s Ministry of Water Resources had still not officially communicated the final COD to the Power Division. By April 11, 2019, the project had injected 2,400 GWh of energy into the national grid.  This project was plagued by controversy. In a performance audit of the project that Pakistan’s Auditor General (AG) submitted to the parliament in February 2019, the AG concluded that ‘NJHP is an exemplary mismanaged project resulting into heavy cost and time overrun.’ The audit reported an ‘unjustified abnormal cost overrun of [PKR 389 billion]’ and losses due to non-achievement of envisaged financial benefits of PKR 237 billion. It also reported losses of PKR 30 billion of revenue and an unjustified claim of PKR 175 million rock burst and an unjustified and uneconomical deployment of tunnel boring machine that failed to achieve envisaged benefits of PKR 23.15 billion. The audit also pointed to the irregular and unjustified award of construction of contract of PKR 90.90 billion before the appointment of consultants and non-obtaining of performance guarantees worth PKR 48.8 billion resulting into suspension of foreign loans and delay in the project. Also, the AG highlighted poor performance of consultants for the project engaged at the cost of PKR 16 billion and non-recovery of PKR 9.90 billion as liquidity damages from the contractors. Other problems identified by the audit include non-achievement of financial close till the project completion, delays in land acquisition, delays in adequate power supply, frequent major design changes, non-finalization of detailed engineering design, and frequent issuance of variation orders. Transparency International Pakistan also alleged that the procurement of tunnel-boring machines (TBM), which were meant to speed up the excavation of the remaining tunnels, resulted in $74 million in kickbacks.   Then, in November 2019, NJHPC CEO Mohammad Zareen testified before Pakistan's National Assembly Standing Committee on Planning and Development and noted that '[i]f revenue from the Central Power Purchase Agency (CPPA) does not commence by December 2019, the NJHPC/Wapda/GoP shall go into default due to back-to-back guarantee, apart from the NJHPC not meeting the routine maintenance expense.' Mohammad Zareen also testified that CGGC-CMEC abandoned the project after it had achieved a 99.6% completion rate and after shelling by the Indian Army at the dam site in July 2019 and October 2019. He said the Chinese contractor was not willing to return. Mohammad  Zareen said the company’s annual debt service liability amounted to Rs 50 billion and it was getting regular letters from the Economic Affairs Division (EAD) every month for the servicing of debt to external lenders. 'I will not have the funds to pay even for salaries after December [2019]', he said, adding that the Rs 100 billion raised from local banks was currently being utilized for debt servicing and salaries.  He also noted that Central Power Purchase Agency (CPPA) CPPA had not signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with NJHPC: 'The PPA between the CPPA-G and the NJHPC, drafted and cleared by the legal section of the CPPA in June 2019, was submitted to the CPPA in July 2019 for approval of invoicing of payment of energy delivered, but is not being approved.' Consequently, NJHPC was not paid for energy delivered through the end of 2019. The non-signing of the PPA between the CPPA and NJHPC resulted in a circular debt build-up of about Rs 75 billion.  On July 4, 2022, when the power plant was running at its full capacity (969MW), an abnormal increase in water leakage was observed which was controlled through continuous drainage pumps and an investigation into the excessive leakage was started. On July 5, 2022, an emergency meeting was held between the project management and the project consultants team to analyze the situation and determine the root cause of excessive water leakage. It was observed that tailrace tunnel had obtained an abnormal pressure of 616m instead of the normal 600m. It was also pointed out by the project consultants that abnormal pressure of 616m in the TRT (tailrace tunnel) had been recorded which otherwise remained below 600 meter. Accordingly, to ascertain behaviour of TRT, one unit was shut down which resulted in decrease in pressure to 608m. The consultants recommended that TRT pressure should be below 604m. In this way, load was reduced gradually. Then, on July 6, 2022, it was determined that the abnormal increase in pressure and water leakages/seepage was due to blockage in TRT and considering the safety of the structure and all other equipment, the power house was shut down. Soon afterwards and after necessary preparation (lowering of bulkhead gates by Mobile Crane, functional check of dewatering pumps etc.), dewatering was started on July 10, 2022. After completion of dewatering up to the main collapse point (293m), an inspection of the tunnel was carried out. According to the findings of a report, 'It was found that tunnel is fully blocked in 42m portion (between 251m and 293m) besides other damages.' Upon submission of the report to the Prime Minister's Office, a meeting was held on July 13., 2022 in which the Prime Minister instructed the government to engage a foreign consulting firm for determine the causes of the defect and seek advice on the remedial works. A detailed ToR for consulting firms was issued by the Prime Minister's Office, which was later finalized by the inter-ministerial committee at a meeting held on July 26, 2022. Immediately after the incident, CGGC was engaged for carrying out repairs. The contractor started mobilization at the site and subsequently a contract agreement was signed with the firm on August 25, 2022. Work on the restoration of plant commenced shortly thereafter. However, in September 2022, Chinese engineers and staff reportedly abandoned the repair of the 969 MW Neelum-Jhelum hydropower facility, which faced issues related to substantial cracks in a tunnel, resulting in a shutdown of the power plant coinciding with a power crisis in the country.  The Chinese workers were reportedly facing security issues with local residents. The Government of Pakistan, at the time, rejected claims that work has stopped at the project site.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company",505360375.381046,"The project is located some 100 km northwest of Islamabad in the Kashmir region.

An environmental permitting meeting held in Sugözü in September 2012 was met with protests from locals and environmentalists. There was no news on the project for several years, and it seemed possible that it had been abandoned. Along with numerous other proposals, the proposal was revived in 2014 as the 1,200-MW, two-unit Hunutlu plant. The project began the public comment period for environmental permitting in June 2014. In 2015, the land was expropriated, with the price being set at 100 lira per square meter. The Turkish Energy Market Regulation Authority (EPDK) finally permitted the project construction and issued a 49-year generation license on July 9, 2015. Then, on June 29, 2016, Adana Bar, Turkish Bar Associations, Medical Chamber of Adana, Agriculture and Engineers Chamber of Adana and Doğu Akdeniz Çevre Dernekleri (East Mediterranean Environment Associations) filed a lawsuit against seven coal-fired power plant projects in the region, including the Emba Hunutlu power plant. Eighteen months later, on January 30, 2018, the expert report for the court case filed by Adana Bar, Turkish Bar Associations, Medical Chamber of Adana, Agriculture and Engineers Chamber of Adana and Doğu Akdeniz Çevre Dernekleri (East Mediterranean Environment Associations) was published, acknowledging that the Emba Hunutlu power plant would harm the public health and agricultural production in the area. Then, on October 30, 2018, the hearing of the court case by Adana Bar, Turkish Bar Associations, Medical Chamber of Adana, Agriculture and Engineers Chamber of Adana Doğu Akdeniz Çevre Dernekleri (East Mediterranean Environment Associations) was held in Ankara. Despite the expert report, which stated the harmful effects of the plant, the Ankara District Administrative Court decided not to cancel the permit of the Emba Hunutlu power plant.   In April 2019, China Development Bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China signed a $1.381 billion syndicated buyer’s credit facility (loan) agreement with EMBA Elektrik Üretim A.S. (also known as ‘EMBA Electricity Production’) — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of Shanghai Electric Power (SEP, 50.01%), AVIC International Project Engineering (2.99%), and two local Turkish investors (47%) — for the 1320 MW Coal-Fired Emba Hunutlu Power Station Construction Project. All three banks acted as joint-lead managers and bookrunners and each bank contributed USD 460 million to the overall syndicated loan. See #91516 for ICBC’s contribution and #91517 for Bank of China’s contribution. The loan carries a 15-year maturity. It is a senior secured amortizing term loan that matures on March 29, 2034. Sinosure provided two overseas investment (equity and debt) insurance policies, with a maximum underwritten amount of $280 million for the equity component and $2.04 billion for the debt component (covering the loan’s principal and interest). Both insurance policies covered the risks of inconvertibility and transfer restrictions, expropriation, war and political violence, with an insurance liability period of 180 months. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $1.7 billion commercial (EPC) contract between EMBA Elektrik Uretim A.S., CLP Power Engineering Co., Ltd (CPIPEC or 上海能源科技发展有限公司), and AVIC-INTL Project Engineering Company, which was initially signed on October 26, 2017 and subsequently revised and updated on April 25, 2019. The 1320 MW Coal-Fired Emba Hunutlu Power Station Construction Project is being financed as an independent power project (IPP) and financed with a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20.   The purpose of the project is to construct a 1200MW supercritical coal-fired power plant — with two 660MW power generation units (‘Unit 1’ and ‘Unit 2’) — in the village of Sugözü village, the district of Yumurtalık, and the province of Adana near the Syrian border. The project will feature two seawater desalination systems to provide 7,320m³ of desalinated water per day for the plant’s operations. A selective catalytic reduction (SCR) DeNOx system will be installed at the plant for the efficient conversion of harmful oxides of nitrogen into N2 and H2O using ammonia. Additionally, facilities such as flue gas desulphurization unit along with dry and wet electrostatic precipitator system will be installed to minimize the dust and particulate emissions from the plant.   The primary infrastructure at the project site will include a turbine building, a crusher house platform, a comprehensive building platform, and an intake platform. In addition, the plant will feature a jetty and associated facilities, and a trestle with a connected road. The power generated by the Hunutlu thermal power plant will be evacuated through 380kV transmission lines and transmitted to the national grid operated by Turkish Electricity Transmission Corporation (TEIAS). The plant will be connected to the electricity transmission line between the Mersin 380 substation and the İsken TPP. A transmission line connecting Hunutlu TPP and Adana 380kV substation will be constructed as part of the project, in addition to three feeder displacement works at Adana 380kV substation. The project also includes the construction a port to receive coal. Upon completion, the plant will reportedly be capable of delivering up to 11.5 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electricity to the country’s national grid annually. It is expected to contribute an estimated 3% of all electricity supplied across Turkey. The project also expected to provide employment opportunities for 4,000 employees during construction and 500 employees during production phase.   CLP Power Engineering Co., Ltd (CPIPEC or 上海能源科技发展有限公司) and AVIC-INTL Project Engineering Company are the general EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. However, several subcontractors are also involved, including Anhui No.1 Electric Power Construction Co., Ltd. (a subsidiary of China Energy Engineering Group), Ilk Construction, Hyflux Newspring Construction Engineering (Shanghai), ÇİMTEK Mühendislik Mimarlık, HNM Zemin Yapı, and ESI Eurosilo. Preliminary excavation works began in July 2018. Then, a logistical voyage ceremony took place in Shanghai on August 25, 2019, but on-site construction activities did not begin until September 22, 2019. In 2020, Turkey was the worst-hit country by COVID-19 in the MENA region, with over 1.8 million infections. However, altogether 1,831 Chinese and Turkish personnel chose to stay and continue working on the project. In August 2020, to speed up the construction, 455 Chinese staff members flew to Turkey and joined the project, despite the health risks. On February 17, 2020, the project’s first truss gantry crane was successfully hoisted into place. On March 21, 2020, the first steel structure of the Unit 2 boiler was successfully hoisted into place. On July 22, 2020, the power plant’s Unit 1 boiler was successfully hoisted into place. On March 10, 2021, the power plant’s Unit 2 boiler water storage tank furnace was successfully hoisted in place. On April 29, 2021, the steam turbines for Unit 1 and Unit 2 were successfully installed. On September 3, 2021, Unit 1 passed a hydraulic test, thereby laying a foundation for its commissioning. On June 18, 2022, Unit 1 began operations.   In June 2020, this project became a subject of local controversy when more than 20 non-governmental organizations called on Chinese banks to withdraw financial support for a coal-fired power plant under construction in Turkey, citing environmental damage and a disregard for the “green” pledge of China’s Belt and Road Initiative. The groups sent letters to China Development Bank, Bank of China Ltd., and Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., asking them to halt financing for the 1320 MW Coal-Fired Emba Hunutlu Power Station Construction Project.

China Eximbank contributed $461 million to the loan syndicate (captured via Project ID#52763) and ICBC contributed $400 million to the loan syndicate (captured via Project ID#92382). The loan reportedly carried a 4% interest rate, but its maturity length and grace period are unknown. The project sponsors (CSI, Sinohydro Corporation Ltd., and ITD) issued loan repayment guarantees in proportion to their ownership stakes in FDEE (e.g. Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. guaranteed 15% of the $861 million loan). The proceeds of the loan are to be used by the borrower to partially finance a commercial (EPC) contract between Bangladesh Bridge Authority (BBA) and China National Import and Export Corporation, which was signed on November 30, 2017. The $1.263 billion project is a public-private partnership (PPP) that is being implemented on a build-operate-transfer (BOT) basis and financed according to a debt-equity ratio of 65:35.   On April 2, 2020, the first loan disbursement (worth RMB 390 million) was made. By June 2023, the loan had achieved a 39.9% disbursement rate ($343.9 million out of $861 million).  The purpose of the project is the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of a four-lane Elevated Expressway that will commence at Shahjalal International Airport and run alongside New Airport Road, with the rail alignment through the Mohakhali, Tejgaon, and Moghbazar to Kamalapur Railway-station and then the alignment crossing over Jatrabari before connecting to Dhaka Chittagong Highway. The scope of works includes the construction of culverts, toll plazas, underpass and overpass, lay byes, wayside amenities; installation of a computerized toll collection system, providing adequate lights and development of service areas with all required facilities. The total length of the Dhaka Elevated Expressway (also known as the Dhaka-Ashulia Elevated Expressway) is approximately 46.73 km.

The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 7 year grace period, a 20 year maturity, a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The borrower agreed to deposit project-related revenues in a revenue account to facilitate repayment. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the total cost ($497,468,255) of a commercial contract between China Harbour Engineering Company Limited and Cameroon's Ministry of Economy. The Republic of Cameroon originally agreed to cover the remaining 15% of the project cost, but it later renegotiated and reportedly did not pay for this component of the project.   As of December 31, 2020, the loan (PBC) had achieved a 100% disbursement rate. The loan’s outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 191.5 billion as of December 31, 2020.    The purpose of the project was undertake the first phase of the construct of a deep seaport in the Atlantic coast town of Kribi, 300 km south of Yaounde. Upon completion, the main port was expected to receive large vessels with a capacity close to 100,000 tons.  Construction began on January 10, 2010, and an official groundbreaking ceremony took place on October 8, 2011. The project was completed on April 6, 2015.   Project ID#350 captures the China Eximbank PBC for Phase 1 of the Kribi Deep Sea Port Project. China Eximbank also provided financing for Phase 2 of the Kribi Deep Sea Port Project via a GCL (as captured via Project ID#53116) as well as a PBC (as captured via Project ID#53396).   Phase 2 of the Kribi Deep Sea Port Project was completed on March 2, 2018.  Following a call for tenders, the right to manage the container terminal of the port was awarded to a consortium made up of CHEC and two French companies, Bolloré and CMA CGM, while the right to operate the multipurpose terminal went to the consortium of the French Necotrans and the Cameroonian Kribi Port Multi Operators (KPMO).  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the first and second phases of the Kribi Deep Sea Port Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.’","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Recipient Government Agency|Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Government Agency",520239316.70736,"The Kribi Deep Seaport Project is located in the the Atlantic coast town of Kribi, 300 km south of Yaounde.

The total estimated cost of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project was $612 million.   The purpose of the first phase of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project was to construct a new eight-lane asphalt expressway stretching 78 km from Addis Ababa to Adama. The alignment starts from Tulu Dimtu. The main road of the expressway continues 2.8 km along the proposed Addis Adaba outer ring road and then crosses Dukem, Bishoftu and Modjo on their east side. It then passes the old Addis Adama road at 62km and bypasses around Adama on the south side. The expressway ends on the east side of Adama and connects to Adama Awash road. The expressway has 18 km of link road and 7.2 km of frontage road on either side in Adama. The road work involved the construction of six interchanges, three intersections, 77 slab culverts, 36 underpasses and 43 overpasses. The 5.4m-high overpasses are supported by 73t girders, reinforced concrete piers and stone structures. Pedestrians, agricultural vehicles and cars can use three of the underpasses. The underpass for agricultural vehicles has a width of 4.5m and a height of 3.2m. The pedestrian underpass is 4.5m wide and 2.2m high. Car underpasses are larger in size with 6.5m width and 4.5m height. Flood discharge was used to size the culverts, which was designed according to velocity, water scouring and water levels. The project also included the construction of two main toll gates and 13 ramp toll gates.   The ultimate objective of the project was to reduce the travel time on Ethiopia's main import-export route from three hours to one hour. The project also sought to lay the groundwork for the use of innovative technology via tolls and creates local employment opportunities. Upon completion, the project was expected to contribute to the development of roadways between the capital city and other regions, such as Hawassa and Bale.    The Addis-Adama Expressway (AAE) is fully access-controlled and managed by Ethiopian Toll Road Enterprise (ETRE). CCCC was the EPC contractor responsible for the implementation of the project’s first phase and second phase. Phase 1 construction began on April 21, 2010.  According to Samson Wondimu, the Communication Director of ERA, the project’s first phase had achieved a 33.6% completion rate as of April 2012. By September 2012, it had achieved a 50% completion rate. A completion ceremony for the first phase of the project was held on May 5, 2014. The second phase of the project (also known as the Lebu-Akaki-Information Technology Park Outer Ring Road Project, the Lebu-Akaki IT Park Outer Ring Road Project, and the Akaki-Goro and Akaki-Lebu Road Project) involved the construction of a 28.1 km toll road — with three lanes each 3.5 meters wide — that links Adama Town in Oromia State with Addis Ababa. Phase 2 supported two road sections: a 14.6 km Akaki-ICT Park (Goro) road section and a 13.6 km Akaki-Lebu road section. Phase 2 also involved the construction of six bridges, one railway line interchange, and three interchanges at Tulu Dimitu, Akaki and Lebu. Upon completion, the project’s second phase was expected to ease traffic congestion along the Akaki-Bishoftu corridor. Phase 2 began implementation on May 5, 2014 and was originally scheduled to reach completion within 25 months (June 5, 2016). By November 27, 2014, the second phase of the project had achieved a 27% completion rate. By June 2015, the second phase of the project had achieved a 50% completion rate. Phase 2 was ultimately completed on August 6, 2016.   After the completion of first and second phases of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project, traffic volumes on the expressway reportedly exceeded 20,000 vehicles per day on the two-lane road trunk road between Addis Ababa and Adama. In October 2019, an official from the Ethiopian Toll Roads Enterprise (ETRE) reported that around 33 million cars had used the toll expressway over the previous five years, generating around $34 million of revenue for the country. However, according to an October 2021 report, '[a]fter 5 years [the expressway] has earned back only about $30 million in toll revenue, well short of expectations. Ethiopia built the toll road parallel to an existing free highway, and a lot of the traffic has remained on the old road.’  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Government Agency",524201506.847902,"The purpose of the first phase of the Addis Ababa-Adama Expressway Project was to construct a new eight-lane asphalt expressway stretching 78 km from Addis Ababa to Adama.

The loan carried a 14 year maturity and a 4 year grace period. Its interest rate is unknown. The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina did not issue a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. However, EFT (Holdings) ApS and EFT International Investment Holdings Limited both issued repayment guarantees. The borrower also purchased a buyer’s credit insurance policy from Sinosure.   As an additional credit enhancement, all of the assets and future profits of EFT Rudnik i Termoelektrana Stanari d.o.o. were pledged as sources of collateral to CDB in the event that the borrower could not repay the loan (and the Concessions Commission of the Government of the Republic of Srpska had to make an adjustment to its own rules to ensure that CDB could dispose of the 2008 concession agreement in the event that EFT Rudnik i Termoelektrana Stanari d.o.o. was not able to meet its repayment obligations under the loan agreement).  The borrower pledged its cash deposits in a set of onshore and offshore bank accounts, a mortgage on land and buildings, monetary claims and receivables under certain power purchase agreements, among other things.

The power plant was to be fueled by lignite from the nearby Stanari lignite mine. Upon completion, the power plant was expected to generate 900 permanent jobs and 2,000 gigawatt-hours (GWhs) of electricit each year. DEC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. The first CDB loan disbursement took place on December 24, 2012.   Then, in April 2013, excavation work for the foundation of the power plant commenced.

Then, on September 3, 2008, China Eximbank and the Government of Ghana signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth RMB 2.1 billion ($330 million). The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 17.2 year-maturity (final maturity date: November 21, 2025), a 5-year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2013), an interest rate of CIRR plus a margin of 0.75% (6.13%), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity (final maturity date: September 3, 2028), a 7 year grace period (first repayment date: September 3, 2015), a 0.3% commitment fee, and a 0.3% management fee. The GCL is captured via Project ID#30801 and the BCL is captured via Project ID#183. The BCL was collateralized with (a) net revenue from a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) between Bui Power Authority — an organization with a mandate to plan, execute and manage the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant Project — and the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG) for the purchase of the energy to be generated from the Bui hydroelectric power plant, and (b) receivables from Ghana Cocoa Board’s sale of up to 30,000 tons of main crop cocoa and 10,000 tons of light crop cocoa per annum to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing under a 20-year, Cocoa Sales Agreement (CSA); and (c) and a mortgage of the land and building and equipment and machinery of the Bui Hydroelectric Power Plant. The cocoa beans were sold at the prevailing market price rather than a fixed price, and the proceeds were to be placed in a Government of Ghana bank account to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). Then, once the dam was operational (and the cocoa agreement came to an end), 85% of the proceeds from sales of energy generated by the Bui hydroelectric power plant were to be placed in an escrow account held by China Eximbank to facilitate loan repayment (and provide a source of security for the BCL). The borrower was expected to maintain a minimum cash balance in the escrow account. The escrow account balance was $27,275,000 in 2018 and $25,582,000 in 2019. The Government of Ghana bank account (for the cash proceeds from COCOBOD’s sale of cocoa to Genertec International Corporation of Beijing) had a balance of $167,816,000 in 2018 and $209,783,000 in 2019. The GCL, by contrast, was not collateralized; it was backed by the full faith and credit of the Government of Ghana. The borrower also purchased a buyer’s credit insurance policy from Sinosure at a cost of $25 million for the BCL (i.e. 8.5% of the face value of the BCL).

According to the Government of Ghana’s Development Cooperation Management Information System (Gh-DCMIS), the $75.4 million PBC and the $76,206,939 BCL jointly achieved a 54.7% average disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 8 loan disbursements (worth $82,949,965.55) between 2014 and 2017: a $18,800,258.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #39) on April 9, 2014, a $8,065,407.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #35) on December 19, 2014, a $1,538,389.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #36) on December 31, 2014, a $3,649,254.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #37) on December 31, 2014, a $6,937,499.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #38) on April 9, 2015, a $14,815,581.00 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #40) on July 16, 2015, a $12,775,468.25 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #41) on March 11, 2016, and a $16,368,109.30 disbursement (for invoice/interim payment certificate #42) on January 25, 2017.  The 2008 GCL's (principal) amount outstanding was $297,615,000 in 2018, $301,237,000 in 2019, GHS 926,830,000 ($165,505,357) in 2020, and GHS 889,400,000 ($171,038,461) in 2021. The 2012 PBC's amount outstanding was $78,582,000 in 2018, $78,583,000 in 2019, GHS 415,680,000 ($74,228,571) in 2020, and GHS 399,990,000 ($76,921,153) in 2021. The 2007 BCL’s amount outstanding was $166,166,000 in 2018, $143,051,000 in 2019, GHS 621,650,000 ($111,008,928) in 2020, and GHS 618,100,000 ($118,865,384) in 2021.

The 2008 GCL's amount outstanding was $297,615,000 in 2018 and $301,237,000 in 2019. The 2012 PBC's amount outstanding was $78,582,000 in 2018 and $78,583,000 in 2019. The 2007 BCL’s amount outstanding was $166,166,000 in 2018 and $143,051,000 in 2019. The 2012 BCL’s amount outstanding was $41,348,000 in 2018 and $37,137,000 in 2019.  The GCL and PBC were eventually rescheduled such that repayments would commence on July 15, 2023 and end on July 15, 2037, which implies a maturity extension of 8.8 years and a grace period extension of 7.8 years for the GCL and a maturity extension of 5.2 years and a grace period extension of 6.2 years for the PBC. The 2% interest rate that originally applied to both the GCL and PBC also increased to 2.7% as part of the rescheduling. The GCL rescheduling is captured via Project ID#95483. The PBC rescheduling is captured via Project ID#95484.  The Bui Dam Construction Project had six components: (1) a roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) gravity dam incorporating a 5-bay spillway; (2) three penstocks in the middle of the dam; (3) a powerhouse at the toe of the dam on the left bank; (4) two rock fill saddle dams on the right bank; (5) a switchyard; and (6) 276 km of transmission lines; and a permanent bridge downstream of the dam.   Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by Bui Power Authority. The dam was designed by the French engineering firm Coyne et Bellier, which also served as the consulting engineers on the project. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on August 24, 2007. However, construction did not begin until December 2, 2008. Then, on May 3, 2013, the first generator was inaugurated. The dam was inaugurated on December 19, 2013. However, the project was not completed and handed over to the Ghanaian authorities until November 28, 2016.   There are many indications that the China Eximbank loans for the Bui Dam Construction Project have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. First, in August 2017, the Ghana Cocoa Board (Cocobod) — a state-owned company whose export receipts provide an important source of revenue for loan repayment to China Eximbank — told the country’s parliament it was in financial distress due to its loan repayment obligations related to the construction of the Bui Dam. Second, at least two of the four loans were rescheduled. Third, in April 2023, Samuel Kofi Dzamesi, the Chief Executive Officer of BPA revealed that the ECG had accumulated $612 million of payment arrears (overdue payments) to BPA. ECG’s payments to BPA for electricity purchases were originally intended to be the main source of revenue for repaying China Eximbank. Fourth, according to the World Bank’s International Development Statistics, the Government of Ghana had accumulated principal and interest arrears to one or more official sector Chinese creditors worth $908,337,346.70) in 2020 ($763,228,526.60 in principal arrears and $145,108,820.10 in interest arrears). Fifth, on December 19, 2022, the Government of Ghana announced a sovereign default, suspending debt service on its Eurobonds, its commercial loans, and most of its bilateral loans.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company",528095003.517172,"Bui Dam is located on the Black Volta river at the Bui Gorge, at the southern end of Bui National Park.

KPCL is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) that was created for the purpose of financing, building, operating and maintaining the 720 MW run-of-the-river Karot hydropower plant on the Jhelum River in Pakistan. China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Limited (C-SAIL)—an investment holding company formed by China Three Gorges Corporation on September 30, 2011 in the Cayman Islands, to acquire, develop, build, own and operate renewable power generation projects in Pakistan—holds a 93% ownership stake in KPCL, while Pakistan's Associated Technologies holds a 7% ownership stake in KPCL.   In October 2009, PPIB approved a feasibility study report for the 720MW Karot hydropower project and Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) granted KPCL a generation license to develop the project on November 2013. Then, on September 9, 2016, KPCL and the Central Power Purchasing Agency–Guarantee (CPPA-G) signed a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) for the Karot Hydropower Project.   On February 22, 2017, China Development Bank (CDB), the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank), and the Silk Road Fund (SRF) signed a $1.292 billion syndicated buyer's credit (loan) agreement with Karot Power Company (Pvt.) Ltd. (KPCL) for the 720 MW Karot Hydropower Project (captured via Project ID#37233). The borrowing terms of the loan are as follows: a maturity of 17 years, a grace period of 6 years, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 4.75% margin, a 1% arrangement (management), and a 0.5% commitment fee. The borrower is expected to make equal, semi-annual repayments on April 21 and October 21 of each year during the loan's repayment period.  The total cost of the 720 MW Karot Hydropower Project, excluding contingencies, was $1.74 billion and it was financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20. The World Bank Group’s International Finance Corporation (IFC) issued a $100 million loan in support of the project on November 25, 2016. The remaining $1.292 billion of debt financing was provided by this syndicate of Chinese state-owned lenders. CDB's contribution is captured via Project ID#37233. China Eximbank's contribution is captured in Project ID#92310. The Silk Road Fund's contribution is captured via Project ID#92311.  The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $1.6 billion commercial (EPC) contract with Yangtze Three Gorges Technology & Economy Development Co., Ltd. (TGDC). Sinosure also issued a buyer’s credit insurance policy at a cost of $54.3 million, and the borrower pledged the following sources of collateral to the lending syndicate: fixed (project) assets, future rights to electricity charges, and the Sinosure credit insurance policy. Additionally, China Three Gorges Corporation reportedly made a $316.20 million equity investment in project, while Associated Technologies reportedly made a $23.90 million equity investment (captured via Project ID#54012).  The purpose of the independent power project (IPP) is to construct a 720MW hydropower generation complex — with four, 180MW power generation units — near Karot village, some 1.7 kilometers upstream of Karot Bridge and 74 km upstream of Mangla Dam. The project involves the construction of a roc-filled dam, spillway, powerhouse, diversion tunnels, head-race power tunnels and a tail-race tunnel end. The project site is accessible through the Islamabad – Kahuta – Kotli road, approximately 29 kilometers from Kahuta, and 65 kilometers from Islamabad. Upon completion, the power plant is expected to generate 2,970 GWh (net) of clean energy annually and reduce 2.3 million tons of carbon emissions each year. The IPP is being implemented on a Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) basis. KPCL will sell all its energy to the National Transmission and Dispatch Company Limited (NTDC) under a 30-year power purchase agreement [at a levelized tariff of Rs 7.68 (7.57 cents) per unit]. The Government of Pakistan GoP guaranteed the (power purchase) payment obligations of the NTDC to the KPCL.  The Government of Pakistan also issued a 17% return on equity (ROE) guarantee.   The general EPC contractor responsible for implementation is Yangtze Three Gorges Technology & Economy Development Co., Ltd (TGDC). China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) is also involved in implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on April 20, 2015. A construction mobilization ceremony was held on January 10, 2016. A project implementation agreement was signed on September 28, 2016. Then, a “notice to proceed"" was issued to (TGDC) on December 1, 2016. Construction works were 25% complete as of September 2017. On September 22, 2018, the project successfully achieved river closure. Construction works were 70% complete as of January 2020. Then, on May 2, 2021, the first rotor of the power plant was successfully hoisted into place. Construction works were 88% complete as of May 2021. On November 20, 2021, the hydropower station closed the gates of its diversion tunnels and started water storage in its reservoir for future use. To date, the project has reportedly employed 3000-5000 people. The originally expected commercial operation date (COD) of the hydropower plant was December 28, 2021. KPCL is responsible for handing over this project to the Pakistani government after the term of its 30-year concession agreement has expired.  The project has been the subject of local controversy. In August 2019, a complaint was submitted to the IFC’s Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO) by a former employee of the project. The complaint raised concerns about lack of payment of exit wages, as well as discrimination against local workers in relation to access to drinking water, conditions of accommodations and transportation at the project site. Then, in July 2020, a complaint was lodged with CAO by representatives of Building and Wood Workers International (BWI) and the Pakistan Federation of Building and Wood Workers (PFBWW), on behalf of the Awami Labor Union. The complaint raises a range of social issues related to the working conditions and terms of employment, workers' organizations, and grievance redress mechanism at the Karot hydropower plant. The complainants claimed adverse impacts on approximately 3,000 project workers, including violations of IFC Performance Standard 2 on workers’ organizations, health and safety, working conditions and terms of employment, grievance mechanisms, retrenchment, and concerns related to the use of security forces under IFC Performance Standard 4.  There are also some indications that the syndicated loan for the 720MW Karot Hydropower Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lenders. In March 2023, KPCL sought Rs 22.703 billion from Central Power Purchasing Agency–Guarantee (CPPA-G) by April 10, 2023 to settle its outstanding debts (including principal and interest) to SRF, CDB, China Eximbank, and IFC and avoid default.  In a letter to Rehan Akhtar, the CEO of CPPA-G, KPCL’s CEO Wang Minsheng noted that his company had to make mandatory principal, interest, and commitment fee payments and any delays in payment would result in a breach of covenants resulting in an event of default for the company.  He noted that, per section 2.05 of the facility agreements signed by KPCL and its lenders, his company needed to make its second loan repayment (equivalent to 3.31 percent of the outstanding loan amount, or Rs. 22.703 billion) by April 21, 2023. KPCL therefore requested that CPPA-G pay its overdue invoices (receivables) -- worth Rs 4.937 billion -- by April 10, 2023. At the time, invoices were being submitted based on a reference tariff without indexation determined by NEPRA on the actual costs incurred by KPCL at the time of Commercial Operation Date (COD) stage tariff.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company",530843777.671503,"The project is located on Jhelum River, near Karot Bridge in the village of Karot village, Rawalpindi District in the Province of Punjab.

The Government of Pakistan GoP guaranteed the (power purchase) payment obligations of the NTDC to the KPCL.  The Government of Pakistan also issued a 17% return on equity (ROE) guarantee.   The general EPC contractor responsible for implementation is Yangtze Three Gorges Technology & Economy Development Co., Ltd (TGDC). China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) is also involved in implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on April 20, 2015. A construction mobilization ceremony was held on January 10, 2016. A project implementation agreement was signed on September 28, 2016. Then, a “notice to proceed"" was issued to (TGDC) on December 1, 2016. Construction works were 25% complete as of September 2017. On September 22, 2018, the project successfully achieved river closure. Construction works were 70% complete as of January 2020. Then, on May 2, 2021, the first rotor of the power plant was successfully hoisted into place. Construction works were 88% complete as of May 2021. On November 20, 2021, the hydropower station closed the gates of its diversion tunnels and started water storage in its reservoir for future use. To date, the project has reportedly employed 3000-5000 people. The originally expected commercial operation date (COD) of the hydropower plant was December 28, 2021. KPCL is responsible for handing over this project to the Pakistani government after the term of its 30-year concession agreement has expired.  The project has been the subject of local controversy. In August 2019, a complaint was submitted to the IFC’s Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO) by a former employee of the project. The complaint raised concerns about lack of payment of exit wages, as well as discrimination against local workers in relation to access to drinking water, conditions of accommodations and transportation at the project site. Then, in July 2020, a complaint was lodged with CAO by representatives of Building and Wood Workers International (BWI) and the Pakistan Federation of Building and Wood Workers (PFBWW), on behalf of the Awami Labor Union. The complaint raises a range of social issues related to the working conditions and terms of employment, workers' organizations, and grievance redress mechanism at the Karot hydropower plant. The complainants claimed adverse impacts on approximately 3,000 project workers, including violations of IFC Performance Standard 2 on workers’ organizations, health and safety, working conditions and terms of employment, grievance mechanisms, retrenchment, and concerns related to the use of security forces under IFC Performance Standard 4.  There are also some indications that the syndicated loan for the 720MW Karot Hydropower Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lenders. In March 2023, KPCL sought Rs 22.703 billion from Central Power Purchasing Agency–Guarantee (CPPA-G) by April 10, 2023 to settle its outstanding debts (including principal and interest) to SRF, CDB, China Eximbank, and IFC and avoid default.  In a letter to Rehan Akhtar, the CEO of CPPA-G, KPCL’s CEO Wang Minsheng noted that his company had to make mandatory principal, interest, and commitment fee payments and any delays in payment would result in a breach of covenants resulting in an event of default for the company.  He noted that, per section 2.05 of the facility agreements signed by KPCL and its lenders, his company needed to make its second loan repayment (equivalent to 3.31 percent of the outstanding loan amount, or Rs. 22.703 billion) by April 21, 2023. KPCL therefore requested that CPPA-G pay its overdue invoices (receivables) -- worth Rs 4.937 billion -- by April 10, 2023. At the time, invoices were being submitted based on a reference tariff without indexation determined by NEPRA on the actual costs incurred by KPCL at the time of Commercial Operation Date (COD) stage tariff.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Fund","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Other Joint Venture/Special Purpose Vehicle|Chinese State-owned Company",530843777.671503,"The project is located on Jhelum River, near Karot Bridge in the village of Karot village, Rawalpindi District in the Province of Punjab.

49810,"China (People's Republic of)","Indonesia","Asia",2013,2015,"CDB provides $473 million loan for 426MW Celukan Bawang Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project","On July 31, 2013, China Development Bank (CDB) and PT General Energy Bali — a special purpose vehicle and project company that is jointly owned by China Huadian Engineering Co. Ltd. (51%), Singapore’s Merryline International Pte. Ltd (38.49% ownership) and PT General Energy Indonesia (10.51%) — signed a $473 million loan agreement for the 3x142 MW Celukan Bawang Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to partially finance an EPC contract between PT General Energy Bali and China Huadian Engineering Co. Ltd. According to CDB, $367 million was disbursed through this loan by the end of 2014. The 426MW Celukan Bawang Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project was implemented as an Independent Power Project (IPP) and its total cost ($638 million) was financed with a mix of debt and equity.   The purpose of the project was to install a 426-megawatt (MW) coal-fired power plant — with three 142MW generators (Unit 1, Unit 2, and Unit 3) — in Gerokgak District, Buleleng Regency, Bali Province (exact locational coordinates: -8.1962945, 114.8515677). China Huadian Engineering Co. Ltd. was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. The project officially commenced on August 28, 2012. However, construction began on June 3, 2012. All three power generational units entered commercial operation on August 11, 2015. The originally anticipated commercial operations date (COD) of the project was October 30, 2014.   As of May 17, 2017, the power plant had generated 5.2 billion kilowatt hours, accounting for 40% of Bali's total power supply and allowing Bali to stop relying on power generation and supply from Java. However, this project was also plagued by controversy. China Huadian Engineering Co. Ltd. had multiple disagreements with local communities about land acquisition.  In December 2013, February 2015, and apparently on other occasions, local residents blocked the entrance to the construction site, complaining that some of the land being used on the project had never been fully acquired by China Huadian Engineering Co. Ltd. and still belonged to them. Also, people displaced by the construction complained that they had not yet received title to the land that they were supposed to be given in compensation.   China Huadian Engineering Co. Ltd. was also criticized for failing to use local laborers — 90% of the construction workers on the site were apparently foreign workers and some of them were reportedly brought in without proper authorization.  In December 2012, immigration officials seized the passports of 75 illegal foreign workers at the site. In October 2012, members of the Buleleng Regency government threatened to shut down construction at the site until problems were resolved. In April 2013, legislators from the Buleleng Legislative Council visited the construction site and found numerous violations, including use of heavy machinery without safety certificates and use of subsidized fuel in construction.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company",533561289.185792,"The purpose of the project was to install a 426-megawatt (MW) coal-fired power plant — with three 142MW generators (Unit 1, Unit 2, and Unit 3) — in Gerokgak District, Buleleng Regency, Bali Province (exact locational coordinates: -8.1962945, 114.8515677).

The study was completed by a joint venture of Fichtner and Norplan. Energy Infratech, a company based in India, served as the owner’s engineer for the project until September 2017. The consortium of Artelia Eau & Environment and KKATT Consult was appointed as the owner’s engineer in January 2018.  On November 26, 2014, the Government of Uganda and China Eximbank signed a preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC (2014) 33 TOTAL NO. (327) 14202014016565] worth $482,578,200 for the 183MW Isimba Hydropower Station and the Isimba-Bujagali Interconnection Project. Then, on March 12, 2015, the Parliament of Uganda ratified the loan agreement with the following terms: an annual interest rate of 2%, a default (penalty) interest rate of 0%, a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, a 0.25% ($1,206,445.50) management fee, and a 0.25% commitment fee. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $567,738,990.96 commercial contract [number MEMD/WRKS/2013-2014/00022/ERD] between Uganda’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development and China International Water & Electric Corporation (CWE), which was signed on September 6, 2013 and amended on April 10, 2014 and May 20, 2014.   Under the terms of the PBC, the Government to Uganda was responsible for on-lending the full amount of the loan to Uganda Electricity Generation Company Limited (UEGCL) and the Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited (UETCL). The Government of Uganda provided a sovereign guarantee for the loan, and the Government of Uganda was obligated under the terms of the loan to open an escrow (or ‘repayment reserve’) account and deposit funds in the account to facilitate repayment and provide security (i.e. collateral) in the event of default. As of June 30, 2019, the cash balance of the escrow (repayment reserve) account was UGX 35,909,807,892 ($10,772,942.36).  The China Eximbank loan agreement also required that UETCL and UEGCL conclude a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) on a ‘take or pay’ basis for the project, and that UETCL and UEDCL and UMEME (or its successors or assignees) conclude a Power Sale Agreement on a ‘take or pay’ basis, in which UMEME or its successor is obligated to make deposits of revenues generated from the project into the escrow account. The loan agreement also specified that any shortfalls in collections and debt service would be met by the Government of Uganda. UMEME, which became the major privately-owned electricity distributor in Uganda in 2005 after winning a 20-year concession to operate UEDCL's main distribution network, was involved as a contractual signatory to the Isimba PPA in order to safeguard the repayment mechanism and avoid potential risks of revenues being misallocated. The fact that UEGCL was to supply UETCL all available power capacity on a ‘take or pay’ basis means that UETCL was to pay for all available electricity generated by the dam, and not only what was needed. However, in 2019, Uganda’s Auditor General discovered that the generation and sales licenses were in contradiction of the PPA and loan agreement because they stated that ‘the tariff methodology [will] be based on the energy service cost implying that the energy dispatch to UETCL will be influenced by market demand.’   According to the Government of Uganda’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), this loan achieved a 97% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 19 loan disbursements (worth $466,398,955.58) between 2015 and 2022: a $28,386,949.55 disbursement on August 14. 2015, a $72,126,626.59 disbursement on August 17, 2015, a $16,593,182.04 disbursement on November 19, 2015, a $70,494,066.49 disbursement on March 30, 2016, a $44,719,245.87 disbursement on November 8, 2016, a $8,903,102.70 disbursement on December 13, 2016, a $11,634,076.30 disbursement on April 18, 2017, a $9,797,214.32 disbursement on May 26, 2017, a $27,630,000 disbursement on August 8, 2017, a $40,394,439.87 disbursement on November 7, 2017, a $25,338,123.26 disbursement on March 30, 2018, a $9,149,993.75 disbursement on June 26, 2018, a $21,647,503.83 disbursement on November 16, 2018, a $13,983,133.08 disbursement on December 17, 2018, a $10,191,519.25 disbursement on April 4, 2019, a $12,490,242.92 disbursement on June 19, 2019, a $13,684,152.17 disbursement on November 8, 2019, a $2,942,702.21 disbursement on September 17, 2020, and a $26,292,681.38 disbursement on October 27, 2022. According to the Uganda Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development's Report on Public Debt, Grants, Guarantees and Other Financial Liabilities for Financial Year 2021/2022, total loan disbursements amounted to $440,106,274.20 and the loan’s amount outstanding (including arrears) was $391,848,454.20 as of December 31, 2021.   The project involved the construction of Isimba hydropower plant, which is located in the village of Isimba on the Victoria Nile, in Kamuli District. It is 4 km downstream of Simba Falls on the River Nile, approximately 50 km downstream of the source of the Nile. The project site is about 21 km from Kayunga Town as the nearest town and about 65 km from Jinja town. Its exact locational coordinates are: 00°46'18.0""N, 33°02'32.0""E (Latitude:0.771667; Longitude:33.042222). The project also supported the construction of a 132kv Isimba power substation, and the construction of a 41km, 132kv transmission line from Isimba to Bujagali. The Isimba power station will be installed with four vertical Kaplan turbine-generator units with a capacity of 45.8MW per unit, thereby providing a combined installed capacity of 183.2MW. The expected outputs from the 183MW Isimba hydropower station and the Isimba-Bujagali interconnection Project include (1) construction of the 183 MW Isimba hydropower plant, (2) construction of a 132kv Isimba power substation, and (3) construction of a 132kv Isimba-Bujagali double circuit steel tower power transmission line that is approximately 41 km in length. CWE was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, several subcontractors were also involved, including Artelia Eau & Environment, KKATT Consult, and Energy Infratech.   A technical feasibility study, as well as a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP), Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Social Impact Assessment (SIA) for the power plant and transmission line were completed between 2012 and 2014. An SIA undertaken for Isimba dam by the Government of Uganda (GoU) shows that public consultations concerning the project were held in the Kayunga, Kamuli, and Jinja Districts between October and December 2012. The same period is cited for consultations held in connection with the EIA. Field studies of flora and fauna were conducted in March 2013. The EIA was only finished in November 2014 and NEMA granted approval of it on May 19, 2015. The project’s certificate of approval was also issued by the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development (MoEMD) in May 2015. A formal groundbreaking ceremony for the dam took place on October 5, 2013. However, project implementation did not commence until April 30, 2015. At that time construction was expected to be completed within 40 months (August 30, 2018). Construction ended in November 2018. Test flooding of the reservoir and the start of inundation of the Kalagala Falls Site (KFS) took place between November 2018 and February 2019. The power plant was officially commissioned on March 22, 2019. A series of ‘associated infrastructure works’ — including bridges and a connection road to Kamuli — took place after the commissioning of the power plant. The power plant was expected to generate 183.2 megawatts of electricity a year once it achieved a substantial completion mark on March 31, 2019. A takeover certificate was issued to the EPC contractor (CWE) on April 12, 2019, after the Government of Uganda and CWE agreed that all project defects were to be fixed by September 30, 2019. However, on September 16, 2019, local media reports indicated that CWE was stalling the completion of a bridge associated with the 183 MW Isimba dam project over a $42 million payment dispute with UEGCL. CWE alleged that UEGCL was unfairly withholding payment. UEGCL asserted that the payment was being withheld due to nearly 700 dam construction defects that CWE had failed to repair. In June 2021, during a UEGCL board of directors inspection of the project site, the Executive Director of UEGCL, Eng. Harrison Mutikanga, told the media that he was not happy with CWE’s performance because of delays and quality issues. He said that ‘[r]ight now, water is leaking in the concrete to the powerhouse, the contractor has not installed a floating boom, the generator circuit breaker has not been working for one month and because of that, [and] one of the turbine units is not working.’ He also said that ‘[t]he firefighting system automation is also not working, equipment frequently breaks down, the gate on one of the functioning units was designed to last for 10 years but only two years later, the paint is going off and the rubber that is supposed to control water is coming off.’ Without boom lines, Mutikanga explained that the dam risked being affected by the water hyacinth and floating islands, which could translate into national blackouts. Mutikanga also said the delayed completion of the project had led to government losses: ‘We want a plant that is generating electricity reliably, safely and to also make sure that all systems are working. We want all defects fixed with quality equipment so that we contribute to the government objective of social transformation.’ At the time, Mutikanga also denied allegations that UEGCL had not paid CWE: ‘We have paid them up to 93%. We have also started paying the interest on the loan to EXIM Bank (of China).’ UEGCL Board chairperson Eng. Proscovia Njuki added that: ‘[t]he contractor has not been fast as we thought. At first, they were delayed by COVID-19, but we are here to find out the challenges they are facing so that we address them. An agreement was reached to extend the defects liability period by one year to allow for proper completion of all the snags till March 2021, but with the defects we have extended the contract till March 2022. If by then we find out that some gaps are missing, we shall not issue a final certificate of completion.’ Then, on August 11, 2012, a group of engineers, supervisors, IT specialists, welders, and cleaners—worked frantically to restore power in one of the turbines at Isimba dam. The previous three days were reportedly ‘a nightmare’ after one of the workers opened a wrong gate during routine maintenance works on unit three—one of the four Kaplan axial flow turbines—and then the automated gate jammed, causing a flood that submerged four floors, including the powerhouse. Each of the turbine units has a generation capacity of 45.5 MW but only three had been active after the dam was officially commissioned on March 22, 2019. Uganda's Minister of Energy, Ruth Nankabirwa, and the Permanent Secretary of Uganda's Ministry of Energy, Irene Batebe, pitched camp at the project site. Ms Nankabirwa and her team were ushered into the control room. Across the choppy waters was a group of Australian dam engineers armed with monitors that fed footage to the CCTV room. The images gleaned by the divers were startling. Concrete under the water at the spillway gates continued to wash away and crumbling, among other things. The dam has four spillway gates. A spillway gate is raised and adjustable to allow the controlled release of water downstream whenever water levels in the reservoir—the large lake behind the dam—increase[s], including the probable maximum flood. The wearing of spillway waterway concrete requires a total overhaul. In June 30, 2022 correspondence with Irene Batebe, UEGCL chief executive officer, Harrison Mutikanga, flagged the crumbling waterway concrete, saying it was of ‘great risk to the overall stability of the dam with possible catastrophic consequences’ and that ‘UEGCL considers this risk to be of paramount importance as any delays to correct these failures only serves to increase the likelihood of these risks materialising and exposing government to great financial and reputational risk.’ As of August 2022, Isimba dam remained under the Defects Lability Period (DLP)— the time period specified in the contract during which the EPC contractor is legally required to return to a construction site to repair any defects. The DLP was set to expire in late 2022. CWE was reportedly reluctant to address the lingering defects until the summer of 2022. In September 2022, UEGCL employees warned of major safety issues and identified 10 ‘potentially catastrophic defects’ at the dam that, if it were to burst, could lead to massive flooding. The allegations of poor quality control on the part of the CWE are not new. In 2016, a legal claim was filed against the Isimba project in response to a leaked report that alleged that CWE was using substandard materials for construction of the dam.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Other Private Sector|Chinese State-owned Company|Other Private Sector|Recipient Government Agency|Other Private Sector",534260024.001691,"This project support the construction of Isimba hydropower plant, which is located in the village of Isimba on the Victoria Nile, in Kamuli District.

(15%) -- entered into an acquisition facility agreement with the China Development Bank (CDB), China Eximbank, ICBC and Bank of China for a syndicated loan worth $969 million for the MMG's acquisition of the Las Bambas Copper Project. China Development Bank was the leading bank and responsible for about 50% of the loan (captured in Project ID#55427). The co-leading bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, was responsible for about 30% of the loan (captured in Project ID#98781). Bank of China and the Export-Import Bank of China were each responsible for about 10% of the loan (captured in Project ID#98783 and #98780). The loan carried an interest rate set at 6 month LIBOR (.329% according to global-rates.com) + an undisclosed margin (not exceeding 350 basis points per annum) and was to be paid back over 7 years.  The loan was secured by (i.e. collateralized with) share security over the entire share capital of MMG South America Management Co Ltd and each of its subsidiaries including Minera Las Bambas S.A. (“MLB”), a debenture over the assets of MMG South America Management Co Ltd, an assets pledge agreement and production unit mortgage in respect of all of the assets of MLB, assignments of shareholder loans between MMG South America Management Co Ltd and its subsidiaries and security agreements over bank accounts of MLB. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to support a $5.8 billion acquisition of the Las Bambas copper mine. There is evidence that the loan fully disbursed. As of 2014, the borrower had utilized (""drawn down) the entire $969 million acquisition facility.  The Las Bambas Project is a world class copper development project located in Peru, in the provinces of Cotabambas and Grau in the districts of Challhuahuacho, Tambobamba and Coyllurqui, province of Cotabambas, and in the district of Progreso, province of Grau, region of Apurímac, 72 km from Cusco. The Las Bambas Project tenements include approximately 35,000 Ha of land, of which less than 10% has been explored for additional resources. The estimated mine life is over 20 years and further exploration could potentially increase this. The Las Bambas Project is within the Andahuaylas-Yauri copper belt, which hosts the Antapaccay and Constancia copper mines.  The project was approved by Xstrata plc’s Board in July 2010. Its Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) was approved in March 2011. The project’s main construction permit was issued on May 31, 2012. Mass earthworks started on June 1, 2012. The first 50 km of heavy haul road was put into service on September 15, 2012. The first permanent concrete poured (Flotation Area Tower Crane) was poured in August 2012. The project had achieved a 19% completion rate as of October 2012.  MMG completed its acquisition of the Las Bambas mine in August 2014. Mine development began in August 2015 and commercial production began on July 1, 2016.  The mine has resulted in multiple environmental conflicts between 2015 and 2022. About 15,000 people protested the mine during the early phases of construction, resulting in clashes with police who shot and killed four local people. There were continued protests in 2021-2022, when protestors blockaded the mine and complained that they received few benefits from the mine.","Completion","Commercial","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",NA,"State-owned Policy Bank",NA,536387639.617412,"Las Bambas is a large, long-life copper development project located in the Apurimac region of Peru.

Under the terms of this framework agreement, China Eximbank pledged to provide a preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) worth $467,840,000 and a government concessional loan (GCL) worth RMB 569,664,000 for the project. China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh finalized the PBC and GCL agreements on November 3, 2017; however, the loans did not become ‘effective’ until April 2018.   The GCL (captured via Project ID#38349) carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and a 0.2% commitment fee. The PBC (captured via Project ID#53661) carries the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and a 0.25% commitment fee. The first repayment date for the GCL and the PBC was scheduled for April 2023. The GCL and PBC proceeds were to be used by the borrower to finance a $550.4 million commercial (EPC) contract between Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC) and China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau (CPPB), which was signed on December 7, 2016. According to the Government of Bangladesh’s Economic Relations Division (ERD), the GCL had achieved a disbursement rate of 100% (RMB 569,664,000 out of RMB 569,664,000) as of June 30, 2020, while the PBC had achieved a 0% disbursement rate ($0 out of $467,840,000) as of June 30, 2020 and a 46.7% disbursement rate ($218,773,000 out of $467,840,000) as of June 30, 2021. According to the Government of Bangladesh’s ERD, the borrower had not made any repayments under the GCL or the PBC as of June 30, 2021.   The purpose of the project is to construct an oil tanker mooring platform and a 200 km underwater and onshore pipeline in Chittagong, Bangladesh. The project was launched because Bangladesh is not capable of handling large vessels carrying imported crude and finished oil, due to the low navigability of a key river channel and constrained facilities at the main seaport in Chittagong. The single-point mooring system, once constructed, is expected help to offload 1.2 lakh tons of crude oil within only 48 hours and 70,000 tons of diesel in 28 hours. Its annual capacity to offload oil will be nine million tons, and it will be able to save Tk800 crore per year. Upon project completion, liquid fuel oil is expected to be carried to Moheshkhali Island, on the Bay of Bengal in Bangladeshi Cox's Bazar district, through the pipeline from large tankers anchored in the deep sea. Later, the 110-km pipelines installed under the Bay of Bengal and in coastal areas is expected to directly carry the oil to the Eastern Refinery in Chattogram from Moheshkhali. The project also involves the construction of a 146-km offshore pipeline and 74-km onshore pipeline to carry imported oil from the sea to a refinery in Chittagong district, some 242 km southeast of Dhaka, for processing.  CPPB, which is a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), is the contractor responsible for constructing the oil tanker mooring platform as well as establishing the 146 km of the pipeline under the Bay of Bengal to the coast.    In January 2015, CPPB and the Energy Division under the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources of Bangladesh signed an agreement to build a single point mooring system (SPM) in the Bay of Bengal to carry petroleum from vessels at the outer anchorage to depots onshore.    Then, in March 2015, the state-run Eastern Refinery Ltd (ERL) received a technical offer from the CPPB to build the SPM. Before submitting the technical offer, a team from the CPPB visited the project location near Moheshkhali Island in the Bay of Bengal and found the site suitable. The ERL, along with an international consultant, was expected to review the 'lone' technical offer before submitting its evaluation report to the Energy and Mineral Resources Division (EMRD) under Bangladesh’s Ministry of Power, Energy, and Mineral Resources (MPEMR). CPPB was then expected to submit a financial offer on completion of the review.   The project was originally expected to take 36 months to complete, but as of October 2018, CPPB had only completed initial surveying and some design work. Construction began on or around February 20, 2019. Drilling then began on March 15, 2019. The project has also completed channel deep post-trenching of the first offshore pipeline despite great technical difficulties. The maximum trenching depth is 11.9 meters, setting a world record for the deepest offshore pipeline post-trenching in the industry and laying a solid foundation for the overall construction of the project.   Work continued during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021. Strict quality control and safety risk control were reportedly put in place. The project had achieved a 63.5% completion rate as of September 2021 and an 83% completion rate as of June 2022. Its originally scheduled completion date was December 2018. However, it has run behind schedule and is over budget. The project completion deadline was first extended to December 2019. Then, it was extended to June 2022. Then, it was extended again — to June 2023. As of 2022, land owners whose plots of land were acquired for the project claimed not yet been compensated despite multiple cost overruns. The total cost of the project reportedly escalated by 44% and some media sources indicate that China Eximbank agreed to upsize its lending commitments for the project by 20.1% (from Tk 3,903.22 crore to Tk 4,688.26 crore).","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Government Agency",539109883.380692,"Through this project, a diesel and crude oil storage tank will be set up at Moheshkhali Island on the Bay of Bengal in Bangladeshi Cox's Bazar district.

The BCL agreement also specifies that 'in case of arrears on interest payments, the borrower is expected to pay interest on those arrears at an annualized rate equivalent to the interest rate on the respective loan. In case of arrears on interest and principal, then the borrower is expected to pay interest on those arrears at an annualized rate equivalent to the interest rate on the respective loan plus one percent.'   The Government of Sri Lanka on-lent the proceeds of the BCL to Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), the state-owned operator of major commercial ports in Sri Lanka.  China Eximbank disbursed an unknown amount in 2007, an unknown amount in 2008, $153,430,619.03 (Rs. 17,634,548,199) in 2009, $114,859,550.41 (Rs. 12,987,651,775) in 2010, $2,929,597.02 (Rs. 323,888,923) in 2011, and $31,944,655.03 in 2012. The loan's amount outstanding was $248,349,992.17 (Rs. 32,073,358,419) as of December 31, 2013, $223,073,990 as of December 31, 2016 and $69,710,622 as of June 30, 2022.  At the time the loan was contracted, its all-in interest rate was 5.234%. However, at the beginning of the project implementation period, LIBOR increased, pushing up the all-in interest rate to 6.5%. The Government of Sri Lanka and China Eximbank restructured the BCL agreement in October 2008, replacing the loan’s variable interest rate with a fixed interest rate of 6.3% (as captured via Project ID#85184).  Phase I of the Hambantota Port Development Project involved the construction of two breakwaters (312m long eastern b/w and 988m long western b/w), a 17m deep harbor basin, a 210m wide entrance channel, a service berth, a 100,000DWT general purpose berth, a 100,000 DWT oil berth, and various roads and buildings (including an administrative building, a public service building and utility buildings). China Harbor Engineering Co. and Sinohydro were the contractors responsible for project implementation. Construction of the port commenced on January 15, 2008. The first phase of the port was ceremonially opened on November 18, 2010, with the berthing of the naval ship ‘Jetliner’ at the port facilities. November 18, 2010 also marked the date of the President’s birthday and the beginning of Phase II of the Hambantota Port Development Project (HPDP). However, the project was not officially completed until October 30, 2011.  Phases I and II of HPDP have encountered financial management problems and corruption allegations. Hambantota Port generated lower-than-expected container traffic and proved to be commercially nonviable under SLPA ownership. Consequently, SLPA could not service its loans to China Eximbank. In response, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited (CMPort) — a subsidiary of China Merchants Group (a Chinese state-owned enterprise) — purchased a majority ownership stake in the port and the right to operate and develop it for 99 years.  More specifically, on July 29, 2017, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited (CMPort), a subsidiary of China Merchants Group, and Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA) signed a 99-year concession agreement and formed a joint venture to operate Hambantota Port. According to the terms of the joint venture agreement, CMPort acquired an 85% stake in Hambantota International Ports Group (HIPG) and a 49.3% stake in Hambantota International Port Services (HIPS), representing about 70% of the total equity. CMPort was also granted the operating and management rights of HIPG and HIPS as well as the lease and development rights of approximately 11.5 square kilometers of land in the Hambantota port area. CMPort agreed to make a total equity investment of $1.12 billion, of which $974 million would be used to acquire the 85% stake in HIPG and $146 million would be deposited into a bank account in the name of CMPort in Sri Lanka (for the expansion of Hambantota Port and shipping-related business).  According to a July 20, 2017 Cabinet Memorandum entitled ‘Hambantota Port Concession Agreement’ (No. MPS/SEC/2017/32) that was approved by Sri Lanka’s Cabinet on August 4, 2017, when the concession agreement was signed, responsibility for repayment of the China Eximbank loans that were contracted for the construction of Hambantota Port was transferred from SLPA to the General Treasury. Given that the General Treasury was also identified of the recipient of the $974 million cash infusion from CMPort, many media outlets and commentators reported that the arrangement represented a debt-for-equity swap.  Another source of controversy arose in June 2018 when the New York Times reported that $7.6 million had been transferred from a Standard Chartered Bank account controlled by China Harbor Engineering Co. (labelled ‘HPDP Phase 2’) to affiliates of President Rajapaksa’s re-election campaign. The New York Times also reported that checks worth $1.2 million (linked to the ‘HPDP Phase 2’ bank account) were delivered to President Rajapaksa’s official residence.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company",551882491.363094,"On December 30, 2007, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Government of Sri Lanka signed a $306,726,736 buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement [BLA0704] for Phase I of the Hambantota Port Development Project.

The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 3% interest rate, 6 year grace period, 15 year maturity, 0.25% commitment fee, and 0.25% management (front-end) fee. Upon signature of the loan agreement, the Government of Bolivia had to remit a lump-sum payment of $1.231 million (.025% x $492,400,000) to China Eximbank.   The lender made disbursements worth $0 in 2015, $98,480,000 in 2016, $42,406,123 in 2017, $75,629,694 in 2018, and $48,378,339 in 2019, $18,894,243 in 2020, and $12,5757,695 in 2021. The borrower made no principal repayments between 2015 and 2021. However, it paid interest and/or fees worth $763,668 in 2016, $4,258,765 in 2017, $5,825,928 in 2018, $7,046,159 in 2019, and unknown amount in 2020, and $9,108,710 in 2021.

The purpose of the 508.07 km highway construction project is to link the departments of La Paz (west), Beni (northeast) and Pando (north), and improve trade between those regions and the rest of the country. The existing gravel highway is to be widened and paved, and 10 bridges will be constructed. The project is divided into four sections: Section I in the town of Rurrenabaque to Santa Rosa (95.68 km), Section II in the town of Santa Rosa to Australia (169.36 km), Section III in the town of Australia to El Choro (168.16 km), and Section IV in the town of El Choro to Riberalta (74.87 km). In June 2012, the original project contract was awarded to Brazilian construction firm Lupe, but was later scrapped due to community opposition related to the proposed route.   China Railway Construction Corporation (International) Limited was then selected as the contractor responsible for project implementation in August 2014. The Bolivian Highway Administration (ABC) issued an order to commence work to China Railway Construction Corporation (International) Limited on November 30, 2015. Construction then began on October 25, 2016. However, in July 2018, construction was halted by the CRCC because little progress was made. As of mid-2019, the project had only achieved a 15% completion rate.   The project has also become a source of local opposition and controversy. Dust, mud, traffic jams, and poor signaling have blighted the road over the past four years, according to residents and drivers who frequently travel between Rurrenabaque and the towns of Reyes and Santa Rosa, 95-kilometres north of the capital La Paz. The situation is reportedly worse during the dry season, when visibility is very poor and causes accidents. Also, small sewers along the route reportedly do not let water flow properly underneath. In February 2019, at the source of the Siwapi River, on the fringes of the the Santa Rosita communal territory, some 20 kilometers from Rurrenabaque, water from the Beni River collapsed the drain. During the same month, a meter’s worth of water inundated Darnixa Crespo Ciripi's house in the same farming community. Residents of Cosar claim that the size and poor functioning of the drains has caused them to lose chickens, plantain and rice crops. Those affected from the Cosar, Villa Copacabana, San José, Puerto Salinas, Wawa 1 and Río Viejo communities blocked the road in late February 2019, demanding that ABC build a bridge in Siwapi over the international highway, replacing the collapsed sewer. Then, in May 2019, Bolivia’s Public Works Minister Oscar Coca threatened to fine China Railway Construction Corporation (International) Limited for breach of contract. He was reportedly said that ‘[t]here is a serious problem with a road that goes from Rurrenabaque to Riberalta, … [and] unfortunately the company is not complying.’ Scientists have also expressed serious concerns about moving earth, deforestation, seasonal flooding and the destruction of vegetation during the road’s construction, as well as non-disclosure of mitigation and compensation measures by China Railway Construction Corporation (International) Limited. One environmental NGO described it as ‘the most contentious project in the country’.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Recipient Government Agency|Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Government Agency",552608490.460676,"The 508.07 km highway project is divided into four sections: Section I in the town of Rurrenabaque to Santa Rosa (95.68 km), Section II in the town of Santa Rosa to Australia (169.36 km), Section III in the town of Australia to El Choro (168.16 km), and Section IV in the town of El Choro to Riberalta (74.87 km).

The Ethiopian Government issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. The borrowing terms of the loan were as follows: an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus as 3% margin, a 14 year maturity, and 4 year grace period. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance a $647 million commercial (EPC) contract between ESC and China CAMC Engineering Co., Ltd.

The purpose of the project is to construct a sugar mill, construct a 135.5 meter-high and 840 meter-wide ‘May-Day’ irrigation dam on the Zarema River (next to the Waldiba Monastery) with the capacity to hold 3.5 billion cubic meters of water, install irrigation equipment, and construct a 4x30MW biogas power station (cogeneration power plant). About 70% of the electricity generated from the biogas power station (also known as the bagasse-fired power plant) will be used to run the sugar mill and 30% will connect to the surrounding area through a 137 kV electricity transmission line. The sugar mill (plant) will use sugarcane planted on 40,000 hectares of land and get irrigation water from the Tekeze, Kalema and Zarema rivers. Once it is fully operational, the sugar mill is expected to crush 24,000 tons of sugarcane per day (tcd), produce 484,000 tons of sugar per year, and produce 41.654 million liters of ethanol per year. The project site is located in Tigray Regional State’s Western Zone in Welkayit District.   CAMCE is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, Sur Construction is a subcontractor responsible for undertaking the construction of the irrigation dam. The project is being implemented in two phases (stages) and financed via two different loan tranches. On April 10, 2014, CAMCE signed a project design contract. Then, on October 9, 2016, a project commencement ceremony took place. Then, on March 15, 2019, Abraham Tekster, the Deputy Governor of Tigray, conducted an on-site project inspection. The project was originally expected to reach completion within 36 months (October 9, 2019). However, as of December 17, 2019, the Government of Ethiopia’s AMP noted that the ‘[irrigation] dam [was] not completed’ and the ‘field for sugar cane [was] not fully ready [for] production’. As of April 2020, the project had only achieved a 95% completion rate. On November 4, 2020, the Welkait Sugar Mill was damaged in an air raid during the Tigray conflict. The Chinese government ended up evacuating more than 600 of its citizens, including 187 employees from the Welkait Sugar Mill.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Welkait Sugar Mill Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. in 2019, Ethiopia’s Ministry of Finance announced that it was seeking to privatize the Welkait Sugar Mill (as part of a broader effort to address the government’s debt sustainability problems and the ESC’s inability to fund the ongoing operations of multiple, faltering sugar factories). Also, according to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, in August 2021, China Eximbank withheld $339 million loan disbursements for 12 projects and halted project implementation due to Government of Ethiopia’s rapidly dwindling foreign exchange reserves and debt sustainability challenges. Demisu Lemma, the Director of Chinese Cooperation at the Ethiopian Ministry of Finance, noted at the time that the Ethiopian Government was in discussions with China Eximbank about a potential debt rescheduling (that would involved a 5-year maturity extension and a 1-year grace period extension). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs. The CF debt rescheduling talks were still ongoing in mid-2023.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Private Sector",553547615.704244,"The purpose of the project is to construct a sugar mill, construct a 135.5 meter-high and 840 meter-wide ‘May-Day’ irrigation dam on the Zarema River (next to the Waldiba Monastery) with the capacity to hold 3.5 billion cubic meters of water, install irrigation equipment, and construct a 4x30MW biogas power station (cogeneration power plant).

The Government of Djibouti agreed to cover the remainder of the commercial contract cost ($58 million). According to Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry, the PBC (loan) had achieved a 32.2% disbursement rate ($114,115,453 out of $491,793,000) as of 2014 and it ultimately achieved a 84.6% disbursement rate (FDJ 73,753,000,000 out of FDJ 87,146,000,000).    The purpose of the project was to construct a 100 km segment from Ali Sabieh to Nagad of the 756 km Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway from Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, to Doraleh port in Djibouti. CREC and CCECC were the contractors responsible for project implementation. Their EPC contract went into effect on April 12, 2012 and its originally scheduled completion date was April 12, 2017. Construction began on December 31, 2014 (when CCECC laid the first track down in Galile) and the railway was opened for use on January 1, 2018.   This project face several implementation problems. In 2015, President Guelleh pushed for the project to be completed before he stood for re-election in April 2016. Substantially reducing the project’s completion time pressured CCECC to accelerate their work. To address this challenge, CCECC reportedly used its own financing for the project’s initial stages until they received loan disbursements from China Eximban. CCECC also stopped work on the project for at least 2 weeks, and the Djiboutian authorities blamed CCECC manager Ding Zhaojun for the delay, claiming that he hadn’t settled all the required purchases on the Nagad to Doraleh portion. The Djiboutian authorities also complained about CCECC’s poor mismanagement, leading to $24 million in cost overruns because CCECC had not taken electrifying the railway into account. The Djiboutian government also claimed that CCECC used poor quality infrastructure materials and failed to comply with railway regulations. China International Engineering Consulting Corporation was later upon examine the quality of CCECC’s work.   On July 28, 2016, CCECC signed the Ethiopia-Djibouti Railway Operation and Management agreement with a consortium of other Chinese companies. This consortium agreed to manage the railway for 5 years and provide training to Djiboutian workers who would assume management responsibility after the end of the 5-year term. It remains to be seen if the Djibouti-Addis Ababa Railway will find a path to commercial viability. Sinosure reportedly had to step in and write off approximately $1 billion in losses due to the poor commercial performance of the railway. According to a 2021 report published by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI), ‘[t]he railway is electrified along its entire route, to save on fuel, as this would need to be imported […] The decision [to electrify the railway] has, however, presented additional challenges. Energy supply is not always stable in Ethiopia, due to the variable level of water in the country’s dams, exacerbated by climate change. The construction of power transmission lines and lack of energy delayed the start of operations, even after construction was complete […]. The line has been flooded on several occasions, halting or delaying services. The Ethiopian government claims that the standards used by the Chinese companies to build the railway did not take flooding into account. Chinese stakeholders, however, argue that their standards accounted for potential floods, but that, in the flooded sections, tracks were stolen, causing structural damage to the railroad.  Interviews also revealed a number of accidents involving animals (camels in particular) being hit by trains and killed. As the [Ethiopian Railways Corporation] has paid more than the market price for camels in compensation, there are suspicions that people are pushing their camels in front of trains deliberately. The plan is to build a fence along the railway, which should reduce accidents and enable trains to travel faster, from the current 50 km/h to 80 km/h. However, this may in turn create other problems, including interrupting paths used by people and animals; it is not clear whether this has been properly assessed. Profitability is another issue. Initially, the price of a passenger ticket was set at 30 Ethiopian birr (ETB). However, this was subsequently deemed too high and reduced to ETB, meaning that the project will generate less revenue than originally planned. This would not be a problem given that the project was planned to be catalytic, i.e. it was supposed to promote further economic activity, rather than being financially viable on its own. However, the railway does not seem to be playing this catalytic role since its last mile issues (it does not connect directly to the port in Djibouti or to industrial parks in Ethiopia) do not make the train a suitable mode of transport for business purposes. Our interviews revealed that last mile links were not [prioritized] during the construction of the new line, but are now being built. The last mile sections are managed by Ethiopian Shipping, a large parastatal. Ethiopian Shipping does not seem to be fully cooperating with the [Ethiopian Railways Corporation].’    There are some indications that the China Eximbank buyer's credit loan for the 100 km Ali Sabieh to Nagad Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On December 31, 2017, the Government of Djibouti formally requested a restructuring of its loan with China Eximbank for the 100 km Ali Sabieh to Nagad Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project. According to an email correspondence between the Executive Director of AidData and an IMF Mission Chief to Djibouti, in 2019, the Djiboutian authorities conducted discussions with China Eximbank to restructure a 2013 loan for the 100 km Ali Sabieh to Nagad Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project (captured via Project ID#46183). The Djiboutian authorities reported to the IMF that a memorandum of understanding (MOU) had been signed in 2019 to extend the grace period from 5 years to 10 years, extend maturity of the loan from 15 years to 25 years, and to reduce the interest rate from 3.409% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 3% [300 basis points]) to 2.509% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 2.1% [210 basis points]). The Djiboutian authorities also indicated that arrears on interest payments on this loan that had been accumulated during the restructuring discussion (worth 1.2 percent of the country’s GDP) had been restructured—and that they were integrated to the principal and expected to be repaid over the extended amortization period. The new terms of the loan reportedly reduced the present value of the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio by 4 percentage points and smoothed total debt service. However, the final loan restructuring agreement (captured via Project ID#85163) was not signed until September 2, 2020. It not only codified the terms and conditions that were first specified in the 2019 MOU, but also sought to improve the performance and profitability of the railway in order to increase revenue generation. The restructuring agreement was ratified into Djiboutian law in February 2021. Then, in March 2020, International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported that the stock of the Government of Djibouti's external arrears -- including arrears to China, Belgium, Spain, Iran, Italy, Saudi Arabia, and UAE -- stood at $107 million. Two months later, in May 2020, a Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) by the World Bank and the IMF concluded that Djibouti was at a high risk of debt distress.  Then, in March 2022, the World Bank published a report (entitled ‘Djibouti Economic Monitor Winter 2021’), which noted that ‘[o]n the debt side, liquidity tensions are likely to arise due to the payment of deferred debt service linked to the DSSI, the maturing of the two [China Eximbank] loans on the water pipeline project connecting Djibouti to Ethiopia loan in 2022, and the Addis Ababa-Djibouti railway project in 2025.’ Then, on November 29, 2022, the South China Morning Post reported that the Government of Djibouti had suspended debt service payment to China Eximbank. Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry responded to the South China Morning Post report by releasing a public statement on December 7, 2022. The statement by the Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry noted that the Government of Djibouti had honored 85% of its loan repayment obligations in 2022. It also acknowledged that, as part of the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI), China Eximbank agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due in 2020 and 2021 under multiple loan agreements, and that the Government of Djibouti’s debt service obligations tripled with the expiration of DSSI. Then, in 2023, Djibouti’s Ministry of Economy, Finance, and Industry published a report, which identified the Government of Djibouti’s total arrears to China as being equivalent to DJF 24,104,000,000 ($135,285,797) as of December 31, 2022.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company",554760480.111095,"More detailed locational information can be found at https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/6281977#map=8/9.854/40.977","Low income","Precise","Yes"

By November 8, 2021, it had achieved a 75% completion rate. A main line beam erection ceremony was held on December 23, 2021 and attended by the Kenyan President, the Kenyan Minister of Transport, and the Chinese Ambassador to Kenya. By December 2021, the project had achieved a 94% completion rate. As of April 2022, it had achieved a 95% completion rate.

The total cost of the project was $5.9 billion (RMB 37.4 billion) and it was financed according to 60:40 debt-to-equity ratio ($3.54 billion of debt and $2.36 billion of equity).  LCRC directly secured $3.54 billion (RMB 22.45 billion) of debt financing from the Export-Import Bank of China in June 2019 (captured via Project ID#85304), and the Government of Laos and the Chinese Government jointly contributed $730 million and $1.63 billion of equity financing, respectively, for the project. The $3.54 billion debt financing package was reportedly secured by (collateralized against) an equity pledge, an asset mortgage, and a franchise pledge.  In order to make its $730 million equity contribution to the project, the Government of Laos secured a $480 million loan from China Eximbank (captured via Project ID#33726) and it agreed to provide $250 million of its own funding (in annual installments). China Eximbank and the Government of Laos signed the $480 million loan agreement on September 8, 2016. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 2.3%, maturity period of 25 years, and a grace period of 5 years. The Government of Laos did not issue a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan, but it did pledge revenues from a bauxite mine and three potash mines in Laos as sources of collateral to secure the loan. An intergovernmental framework agreement on November 13, 2015 preceded the signing of this loan agreement.  The purpose of the project was to construct a 418 mile long railway segment that connects Kunming, the capital city of southwestern China’s Yunnan Province, with Laos’ capital city of Vientiane. This railway segment passed through the capital of Vientiane and the four Laotian provinces of Luangnamtha, Oudomxay, Luang Prabang, and Vientiane. It was part of a larger Kunming-Singapore Railway Project (also known as the Kunming-Singapore Trans Asian Railway Corridor), which starts from Kunming and ends in Singapore after passing through Laos, Thailand, and Malaysia.  The single-track electrified rail line has a designed speed of 160 km/hour and it is being built in standard gauge. 47% percent of the railway passes through 75 tunnels and 15% passed over viaducts spread over 167 bridges. There were 32 planned stations along the route, and according to the Ministry of Public Works and Transport of Laos, 50 meters of land on either side of the tracks was reserved for the railway's developers. The final station was Thanaleng station. Xay Village in Xaythany District was to be the site of Vientiane Station, the largest station on the railway. Upon completion, the Laos-China Railway was expected to reduce the time necessary to travel from Mohan-Boten to Vientiane from three days to less than three hours. According to a 2012 feasibility study, the internal rate of return (IRR) of the project was projected to be 4.56%. Sinohydro Corporation, Power Construction Corporation of China, China Railway No. 5 Group, China Railway No. 2 Group, and China Railway No. 8 Group were the contractors responsible for implementation.   The formal start of works was announced in December 2015. However, progress was initially slow due to unresolved property issues as well as detailed design works. A groundbreaking ceremony did not take place until December 25, 2016. (Note: An earlier groundbreaking ceremony was abandoned in 2011 after reports emerged that China was demanding large land concessions along the railway line in return for funding its construction.) Large scale implementation began in the summer of 2017. By mid-2018, the project had achieved a 20% completion rate. Then, on March 27, 2020, the first 500-meter-long track segment was successfully laid in Vientiane. Construction of the Vientiane Railway Station commenced on July 3, 2020.   Railway infrastructure was reportedly 90% complete as of July 2020. On October 6, 2021, the China-Laos railway station opened in Vientiane. The project was completed on October 12, 2021, and was put into commercial use later in December 2020. Then, on October 16, 2021, the first train made its public debut in Vientiane, ahead of a test run. The originally expected project completion date was December 2, 2021.

Phase 1 construction activities began on April 15, 2014, and the originally expected project completion date was October 13, 2018; however, by April 29, 2014, there was reportedly a protracted conflict between China First Highway Engineering Co. Ltd. (CFHEC) and the Control Mission led by the SCET-Tunisie/Louis Berger. Project implementation was delayed by unpaid indemnity owed to those living along the first 10 km of highway. The Cameroonian authorities also reportedly made modifications to the specifications of the project by increasing the speed limit from 100 km/hour to 110 km/hour and adding extra lanes, leading the EPC contractor to assert that according to the budget only 47 km of the road could be constructed under such conditions. By January 2015, construction had recommenced, as reported by the China’s Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) who noted that tree felling had taken place along 40 km of the road’s route and that earthworks had started not long before. Then, in 2017, delays in payment to the contractor led to a one month suspension of construction beginning on May 2, 2017 and concluding in June 2017 after settlements were paid.  As of May 2019, Phase 1 had achieved a 74% completion rate. As of February 2020, the project had achieved a 80% completion rate and 6 of 36 engineering structures were not yet finished. In April 2020, the company in charge of supervising the works, SCET-TUNISIE, reported that the project was scheduled to reach completion by December 2020 in spite of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of August 2021, the project had achieved a 98% completion rate.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the Yaounde-Douala Highway Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.’","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Recipient Government Agency|Chinese State-owned Company",566866853.766598,"The Yaounde-Douala highway project project will facilitate the construction of a 215 km road linking Douala on the western coast with capital Yaounde, and Phase I entails a 68.3 km road which runs from Yaoundé to Bot Makak/Bibodi.

Then, on October 25, 2013, China Eximbank and the Public Enterprise for State Roads of the Republic of Macedonia signed a $505,044,966.98 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the Kicevo-Ohrid Motorway Construction Project (captured via Project ID#66444). The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 20-year maturity, a 2% interest rate, a 5 year grace period, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee. The PBC was to be repaid in thirty semi-annual installments. On January 9, 2014, the Government of the Republic of Macedonia issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the PBC. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 90% of the $555,549,463.68 cost of a commercial contract [ID#29-01-135] that it signed with Sinohydro Corporation Limited on June 5, 2012. The remaining 10% was provided by the Public Enterprise for State Roads. The 2013 PBC’s outstanding (principal) amount as of December 31, 2019 was $324,442,683.   The purpose of this project was to construct a 57-km long and 25.2-meter wide highway — with 6 overpasses, 13 underpasses, and a 2 km long tunnel named 'Preseka' — between the city of Kicevo and the city of Ohrid. The highway will pass through Kicevo, Podvis, Preseka, Pesocani, Trebenista, Podmolje, and Ohrid. Sinohydro Bureau 7. Co. Ltd (中国水电七局有限公司) — a subsidiary of Sinohydro Corporation Limited — was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation.   A groundbreaking ceremony took place on February 22, 2014 and the project was originally expected to reach completion on June 30, 2021. However, the project has encountered various delays and cost overruns. Some of these were due to poor geological surveys. Additionally, no intersections were part of the original road plan, which made it impossible to access the highway from villages along its route. To address these cost overruns, China Eximbank and the Public Enterprise for State Roads of the Republic of Macedonia signed an additional PBC agreement worth $179,694,572.51 for the Kicevo-Ohrid Motorway Construction Project in 2019 (captured via Project ID#85195). It carried the same borrowing terms as the PBC that was signed on October 25, 2013: a 20-year maturity, a 2% interest rate, a 5 year grace period, a 0.25% commitment fee, and and a 0.25% management fee. The Government of the Republic of Macedonia issued a sovereign guarantee in support of this PBC on November 21, 2019.   On March 26, 2015, Macedonian opposition leader Zoran Zaev released audio recordings related to the construction of the highways. The recordings provided evidence that the tender process had not been transparent, and only two companies had been approved by the Chinese Embassy in Skopje: CWE and Sinohydro Corporation Limited. Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski was accused of disregarding CWE's lower bid and taking a bribe from Sinohydro Corporation Limited that amounted to 5% of the value of the commercial contract (approximately EUR 20,000,000). The EU intervened and made a deal in which a special prosecutor was appointed, and the Prime Minister stepped down. The special prosecutor charged the former Prime Minister in Charge of Economic Affairs, the former Minister of Transport, and the former Head of the Public Enterprise for National Roads with ‘Abuse of Official Position and Authorization’ on June 29, 2017. Former Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski was charged with ‘Accepting a Reward for Unlawful Influence’; he fled and received political asylum in Hungary. By 2019, the Special Prosecutor was also charged with corruption, the statute of limitations had expired, and no one was found guilty. In May of 2019, evidence was presented by newly appointed Director of Public Enterprise for State Roads that Sinohydro had only built 2.7 km of the highways, and had instead relied on subcontractors. Sinohydro Corporation Limited then marked up the subcontractor's invoices by 54% when it presented its invoices to the Public Enterprise for State Roads. Some of the items in the original bid had been marked up by as much as 300%. In 2019, Sinohydro Corporation Limited went through a more transparent tender process to build the Krupishte-Kocani highway, and the price per cubic meter was four times lower.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company",569709183.252948,"The purpose of this project was to construct a 57-km long and 25.2-meter wide highway — with 6 overpasses, 13 underpasses, and a 2 km long tunnel named 'Preseka' — between the city of Kicevo and the city of Ohrid.

The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a maturity of 20 years, a grace period of 5 to 7 years, and an interest rate of 2%. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the PBC to finance 95% of the cost of a $295.9 million commercial contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC).  The loan was originally scheduled to disburse in 3 annual tranches: $112.4 million in 2007, $112.4 million in 2008, and $56.2 million in 2009.   CRBC was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on July 11, 2006. The construction period was originally scheduled to be 38 months in duration. The highway was commissioned in 2010, but work continued on the Shahristan  tunnel. The project was completed on October 27, 2012, with an opening ceremony for the Shahristan tunnel that was attended by President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon.   Earlier, in March 2006, China and Tajikistan signed a Memorandum of Understanding that stated the terms of preferential credits issuance for promotion of economic and social development of SCO members. One of the financing projects identified was this road project. The purpose of the project — also known as the Tajikistan-Uzbekistan Highway Rehabilitation/Reconstruction Project — was to reconstruct the 354 km highway connecting Dushanbe with Khujand, the center of the northern province, and the town of Chanak on the border with Uzbekistan. The project also involved the construction of the 5253 meter Shahristan tunnel (at a cost of $88,424), the 1047 meter Dusti tunnel, the Maikhura tunnel, 39 big and small bridges, and 6 km of avalanche defenses.   The project reportedly reduced driving times from 12 hours to 4 hours and the Shahristan tunnel was reportedly the longest tunnel in Central Asia when it completed.

The borrowing terms of the loan are as follows: a 14.5 year maturity, a 3 year grace period, and a 3.067% interest rate. The Government of Ethiopia’s Ministry of Finance issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. The borrower also purchased buyer’s credit insurance from Sinosure. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of a $495 million commercial contract between EEPCo and Dongfang Electric Corporation (DEC) for the electro-mechanical and hydraulic steel structure works component of the 1870MW Gilgel Gibe III Hydropower Project, which was signed in May 2010.

The purpose of the project was to supply and install electrical and mechanical equipment (turbines) for the construction of the Gilgel Gibe III Dam (also known as the Gibe III Dam). The Gilgel Gibe III Dam is 610 m-long (2,000 ft) and 243 m (797 ft) high roller-compacted concrete dam. It withholds a reservoir with a capacity of 14.7 km3 (3.5 cu mi) and a surface area of 210 km2 (81 sq mi), collecting with a catchment area of 34,150 km2 (13,190 sq mi). The reservoir's live (active or ‘useful’) storage is 11.75 km3 (2.82 cu mi) and dead storage 2.95 km3 (0.71 cu mi). The normal operating level of the reservoir is 892 m (2,927 ft) above sea level with a maximum of 893 m (2,930 ft) and minimum of 800 m (2,600 ft). The dam's spillway is 108 m (354 ft) long and floodgate-controlled with a maximum discharge capacity of 18,000 m3/s (640,000 cu ft/s). Water above 873 m (2,864 ft) above sea level can be discharged through its gates. Feeding the dam's power house are two penstocks that each branch into five separate tunnels for each individual turbine. The power house contains ten 187 MW generators supported by Francis turbines for a total installed capacity of 1,870 MW.   DEC was responsible for the electro-mechanical and hydraulic steel structure works component of the project. Salini Costruttori S.p.A.(SPA), an Italian contractor, completed the civil engineering construction of the project.   The electro-mechanical portion of the project involved the design; build; site testing and commission of 10 vertical type hydraulic turbines; 10 vertical axis synchronous generators; and other transformer-related tasks. The hydro mechanical portion included the installation of steel structures; gates; a draft tube; a diversion tunnel; a spillway and ecological discharge gates.   The construction of the Gibe III dam began in July 2006 along the Omo River but the project provoked a backlash from environmental activists. The African Development Bank and the European Investment Bank were originally supposed to fund the electro-mechanical costs for the project, but they eventually backed out due to the project's perceived negative environmental and social impacts. In August 2015, Ethiopia commissioned the first phase of electricity generation at the Gibe III plant from three turbines with an output of 561MW. Then, on December 17, 2016, the Gibe III dam was officially inaugurated. The plant has 10 turbines each with a capacity of 187MW equaling a total capacity of 1,870MW, increasing Ethiopia's total electricity output to 4,238 megawatts. This project also reportedly created more than 7,000 jobs.  There are some indications that the ICBC loan for the 1870MW Gilgel Gibe III Hydropower Project  may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country’ (see Project ID#58616). Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs.

The face value of the PBC was approximately 254.4 billion CFA francs, or approximately $534,582,600. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. The proceeds from the GCL and the PBC were used to finance a $663 million EPC contract with China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC). Approximately 95% of the cost of this project was financed by China Eximbank while the remaining 5% was financed by the Government of Gabon itself.  The GCL that supported this project is captured in Project ID#60747. The PBC that supported this project is captured in Project ID#73174.

The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower, National Port Development (SL) Ltd., to finance a $708,295,101 commercial contract that it signed with a consortium of Chinese companies -- consisting of Tidfore Heavy Equipment Group Co., Ltd. (泰富重装集), China Integrity International Oceaneering, Co., Ltd., Tidfore (Tianjin) Oceaneering Equipment Co., Ltd., and Tianjin Jinhao International Trade Co., Ltd.-- which was signed on March 8, 2017 and amended on November 29, 2017. In order to facilitate loan repayment, Tidifore will collect a ‘development levy fee,’ which will be charged over and above the usual port handling charges. This fee is expected to generate $950 million over a 16 year period. Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance and Economic Development has reportedly flagged that this fee could raise the cost using the port to such a high level that shippers will avoid using it, thereby leading to an overall loss of revenue and threatening the borrower’s ability to repay the loan (thus raising concerns about the Government of Sierra Leone’s contingent liability).  The purpose of the Port Elizabeth II Upgrading Project is to renovate the facilities at Queen Elizabeth II Quay in Freetown, which is operated by Sierra Leone Ports Authority. It involves the design and construction of four new terminals and yards for the quay. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on November 29, 2017, and construction began in December 2017.  This project has become a source of local controversy and scrutiny. In 2018, the implementation of the project was reportedly halted (at least temporarily) after reports emerged that the legal entity responsible for the project—National Port Development (SL) Ltd.—was owned by Israeli businessman who had generously contributed to the President of Sierra Leone’s reelection campaign during the previous year. The IMF also sounded the alarm after learning that Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Finance issued a sovereign guarantee in support of a syndicated loan, which placed an extraordinarily large contingent liability (worth 15% of the country’s GDP) on the government’s books.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Commercial Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Other Joint Venture/Special Purpose Vehicle|Recipient Government Agency|Recipient Government Agency|Other Miscellaneous Agency Type|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company",609586885.064095,"The Queen Elizabeth II Quay is located in the capital city of Freetown.

289,"China (People's Republic of)","Cameroon","Africa",2013,2016,"China Eximbank provides $541.6 million buyer's credit loan for Phase 1 of 211MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project (Linked to Project ID#57586)","On January 21, 2013, China Eximbank and the Cameroonian Ministry of Economy, Planning, and Regional Development signed a buyer's credit loan (BCL) agreement (Contract No. BLACAM 2011001) worth $541,566,018 for Phase 1 of the 211 MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. The borrowing terms of the BCL are as follows: a 15-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3.10% margin, a 1% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.50% commitment fee, and a 0.50% management fee. The Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Cameroon agreed to provide the lender with a repayment guarantee (as defined in Article 1 of the BCL agreement). The borrower also purchased buyer's credit insurance from Sinosure. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the total cost ($637,136,492) of a commercial (EPC) contract between Cameroon’s Ministry of Water and Energy and Sinohydro Corporation, which was signed on April 12, 2012.   As of December 31, 2020, the loan (BCL) had achieved a 100% disbursement rate and the its outstanding amount was equivalent to CFA 203.4 billion.   The Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project is a large-scale hydro-electric run-of-river dam and hydroelectric generator plant that involves a barrage that is 1,260 meters long and 14 meters high, with two overflow channels and a grand spillway to the generating plant. The dam site is around 26 square kilometers. The plant has four generators and turbines each. It is expected to inject 211 MW of electricity into Cameroon's energy supply network. The plant is located in Nyabizan on the Ntem River in the South region, 300 km from Yaounde. Sinohydro Corporation was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. On June 15, 2012, President Paul Biya presided over the ceremony to lay the foundation stone of the project. Construction was completed in August 2016.   Project ID#57586 captures a separate China Eximbank loan worth $141.8 million loan for Phase 2 of the 211 MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. The proceeds of this loan were used by the borrower for the construction of 294 pylons between Nyabizan and Ebolowa to evacuate 211MW of power from the Memve'ele dam to Yaounde, the installation of 225 KV transmission lines, and the construction and installation of three transformer substations with a capacity of 225/90 KV in the localities of Ebolowa, Nkoumou in the South Region and Ahala in the Centre Region. As of September 30, 2021, the construction of the Nyabizan-Yaoundé evacuation line had achieved a 92% completion rate. However, the completion of Phase 2 depends on payment of compensation to the people affected by the transmission line’s corridor. According to the Government of Cameroon, the revenue generated by the power plant and Nyabizan-Yaoundé transmission line since ‘powering up’ from April 2019 to October 2021 amounts to CFAF 45 billion. In addition, the partial completion of the 211MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project has reportedly enabled the shutdown of the Ahala, Oyom-Abang, Mbalmayo and Ebolowa thermal power stations.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the 211MW Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In January 2019, Cameroon unilaterally withheld debt service payments to China Eximbank. The lender responded by withholding new loan disbursements. Then, in July 2019, China Eximbank and the Government of Cameroon signed a debt rescheduling agreement (as captured via Project ID#88213). Under the terms of the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to reschedule 18 loans previously contracted by the Government of Cameroon — with scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 — by allowing the borrower to defer scheduled principal repayments between July 2019 and March 2022 to later dates but without any maturity extensions. The total amount of restructured debt was equivalent CFA 148 billion ($253 million) — or 70% of the loan principal that was scheduled for repayment between July 2019 and March 2022. Under the terms of the agreement, the Government of Cameroon agreed to repay 30% of the loan principal according to the original July 2019-March 2022 schedule (i.e. without any payment deferrals). The lender and the borrower also agreed to cancel the committed but undisbursed loan balances worth approximately CFA 10 billion (for certain loans with disbursement deadlines that had already passed). Then, in January 2020, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) classified the Government Cameroon as facing a high risk of debt distress. Eighteen months later, during an address before Cameroon’s National Assembly on June 28, 2021, the Minister of Water and Energy (MINEE) Gaston Eloundou Esommba provided an update on the ICBC-financed Bini à Warak Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. He noted that the project had been 'on hold' since November 2019 because ICBC suspended the loan agreement, even though the Government of Cameroon had already mobilized XAF 22 billion of counterpart funding. He also explained that 'the reason for this suspension is that Cameroon did not settle some of its debts towards China on time, so, it is in a cross-default situation.’","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Recipient Government Agency|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company",610906263.727898,"The Memve'ele Hydroelectric Power Plant Project is a large-scale hydro-electric run-of-river dam and hydroelectric generator plant that involves a barrage that is 1,260 meters long and 14 meters high, with two overflow channels and a grand spillway to the generating plant.

58616,"China (People's Republic of)","Ethiopia","Africa",2015,NA,"ICBC provides $550 million buyer’s credit loan for Omo Kuraz 5 Sugar Plant Project","On July 23, 2015, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) and the Ethiopian Sugar Corporation (ESC) — an Ethiopian state-owned enterprise — signed a $550 million (ETB 11,262,597,025) export buyer’s credit (loan) agreement for the Omo Kuraz 5 Project. The Government of Ethiopia issued a sovereign guarantee for this loan. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: an 8-year maturity, a 3-year grace period, and an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2.95% margin. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the total cost of a $647 million commercial contract between Jianglian Heavy Industry Co., Ltd. and the ESC, which was signed on August 13, 2013.   According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $550 million loan achieved an 88% disbursement rate, with ICBC making 9 loan disbursements (worth ETB 9,961,853,894) between 2016 and 2018: an ETB 2,448,261,038 disbursement on May 31, 2016, an ETB 298,977,218 disbursement on April 30, 2017, an ETB 692,625,989 disbursement on September 18, 2018, an ETB 75,043,474 disbursement on November 23, 2018, an ETB 27,682,313 disbursement on November 23, 2018, an ETB 34,611,272 disbursement on November 23, 2018, an ETB 778,810,201 disbursement on November 23, 2018, an ETB 280,385,250 disbursement on November 23, 2018, and an ETB 5,325,457,140 disbursement on November 23, 2018.   The Omo Kuraz Sugar Project consists of five sugar plants (Omo Kuraz 1, Omo Kuraz 2, Omo Kuraz 3, Omo Kuraz 4, and Omo Kuraz 5). The Omo Kuraz 5 Sugar Plant Project involves the construction of the fifth factory in the Omo-Kuraz Sugar Project. This factory is located in Awi Zone’s Jawi District of Amhara region. Upon completion, the facility is expected to produce 242,000 tons of sugar and 20 million 827 liters ethanol a year at full capacity. As part of the project, extensive irrigation infrastructure is also being constructed on Omo River in order to enable 100,000 hectares of land to be covered with sugarcane.  Jiangxi Jianglian International Engineering Co. Ltd (JJIEC), a subsidiary of Jianglian Heavy Industry, is the contractor responsible for project implementation. According to the ESC, the project is being undertaken in two phases. Phase 1 construction activities commenced in November 2016. To date, 30,000 hectares of land at the project site have been irrigated, of which 16,0000 hectares are covered with sugarcane.   However, this project has also become a source of scandal and controversy. On July 25, 2017, Yuan Jialin, the JJIEC head of the Omo Kuraz 5 Project, was detained in relation to an alleged act of corruption: paying a $30 million bribe (‘commission’) for Ethiopian Ministry of Finance officials to illegally grant a contract to JJIEC. Yuan Jialin, wrote a letter to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed on May 29, 2018, requesting his personal intervention. In his letter, he indicated that he had been denied bail for nearly a year. He also wrote that “JJIEC […] operates on the highest standard and uses fair and competitive system of procurement and carefully controls projects at hand to be free from corruptive and fraudulent activities."" Jialin also argued in the letter that it was difficult to commit corruption in a strictly monitored purchase process. He claimed that there has not been any evidence to substantiate the charges brought against him. He also noted that, while JJIEC recruited a lawyer to investigate the alleged corruption, he was subjected to an inappropriate search which resulted in physical and psychological damages to him. He also asserted that the documentary evidence presented to substantiate the charges against him were counterfeit. He also warned that the ‘dire situation’ of the Omo Kuraz 5 project might hamper the bilateral relations between the Ethiopian Government and JJIEC, and requested that Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed establish a neutral and separate body to see his case and give him a speedy trial.  There are indications that the ICBC loan for the Omo Kuraz 5 Sugar Plant Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform, as of September 2019, ICBC suspended about $67 million worth of loan disbursements for the Omo Kuraz 5 Sugar Plant Project 'due to [the] cross-default situation of the country.' Then, after considerable delay, the G20 Common Framework (CF) creditor committee for Ethiopia convened in September 2021, with the French Government and the Chinese Government serving as co-chairs.

The estimated value of the supplier’s credit (loan) is RMB 2.8577 billion (EUR 270.3 million). In order to finance its supplier’s credit agreement with the Government of Equatorial Guinea, CGGC secured one or more export seller’s credits from China Eximbank. The proceeds of the supplier’s credit were to be used by the borrower to finance approximately 85% of the cost of an RMB 3.362 billion (EUR 318 million) commercial (EPC) contract between the Government of Equatorial Guinea and CGGC, which was signed on February 24, 2008. The borrowing terms of the supplier’s credit are unknown. However, it is known that the supplier’s credit was backed by a Sinosure credit insurance policy, which was finalized in September 2013 and provided $119 million of coverage.   The project involved the (1) the construction of a sewage treatment plant in Malabo (with the capacity of 40,000 cubic meters of sewage and the ability to treat and discharge 10,000-14,000 cubic meters of sewage per day), and (2) construction of a 238 km (or 239.5 km) network of sewage pipes in Malabo. These two project components are known as Phase 1 and Phase 2, respectively. The project also involved the installation of 5 sewage pumping stations. However, it is unclear if this component was undertaken as part of Phase 1 or Phase 2. Upon completion, this project was expected to benefit 100,000 local residents of Malabo.    CGGC was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, Long Jian Road and Bridge Co., Ltd., SCEGC Installation Group Company Ltd., CMEC Comtrans International Co., Ltd., and Anhu Shui'an Construction Group Co., Ltd. were also involved in implementation. Phase 1 took place between August 18, 2008 and August 2012. Phase 2 commenced on June 13, 2013. The Malabo sewage treatment plant and sewage pipe network entered its trial operation period on October 8, 2015. It was officially handed over to the local authorities in 2019. The Malabo sewage treatment plant and sewage pipe network reportedly now collects 14,000 cubic meters of municipal sewage each day (on average) and provide 85% to 90% of the city’s sewage treatment capacity.   However, this project also faced significant implementation and debt repayment challenges. Sinosure made an EUR 6.53 million indemnity payment to CGGC in December 2014 due to the fact that the Government of Equatorial Guinea defaulted on its payment obligations to CGGC.

(CITIC) and Maisan Power Company (MPC) — a special purpose vehicle and subsidiary of Raban Al Safina Group for Energy Projects (RASEP) — for the 840MW Maisan Combined Cycle Power Plant (MCCPP) Project. The estimated monetary value of the syndicated deferred payment (seller’s credit) agreement is $1.7 billion.  CITIC is both the project’s EPC contractor and credit provider. Under the terms of the Deferred Payment Agreement (DPA), CITIC will assign receivables under the EPC contract for the plant’s construction to the syndicate of Chinese banks. Upon assignment of the receivables, the syndicate of Chinese banks will then release funds to CITIC so it can discharge its obligations under the DPA as the credit provider. The owner of the project is Raban Al Safina Group for Energy Projects (RASEP). The purpose of the MCCPP is to construct a 840MW gas-fired, combined-cycle power generation facility.   Once fully functional, the Maysān combined-cycle power plant is expected to supply enough electricity to power approximately three million Iraqi households and businesses. The Maysān combined-cycle power project is located approximately 20km southeast of Amara, in the Maysān Governate, in southern Iraq. The Maysān combined-cycle power plant will be equipped with two SGT5-4000F gas turbines, one SST5-4000 I-L steam turbine, and three SGen5-2000H generators from Siemens. The facility will also feature SPPA-T3000 automation and control systems, transformers, associated electrical equipment, and the fuel gas system, along with waste heat recovery boiler equipment. The gas turbines come with 15-stage axial flow compressor, and four-stage, air-cooled annular combustion system designed to operate at an exhaust temperature of 599ºC. The design incorporates the hydraulic clearance optimization (HCO) technology to reduce clearance loss and increase gas turbine efficiency. Designed to operate at a frequency of 50Hz, both the gas and steam turbines will have a speed of 3,000rpm. The gas turbines will have an efficiency of 58% in combined-cycle operations. The rated output of the gas and steam turbines will be 329MW each. The other components of the power station will includes the fuel gas supply system with inlet filter, pressure regulating line, gas measurement and ignition gas system, heat exchangers, integrated water tanks, and bypass stacks. CITIC is the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation.  However, many other contractors are involved in the project.

More specifically, the purpose of the project was to (a) construct CHASNUPP-III, a 315-MW two-loop pressurized water reactor (PWR), using between 2.4—3.0% low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel with a gross capacity of 340 MW; and (b) construct CHASNUPP-IV, another 315-MW two-loop pressurized reactor with a gross capacity of 340 MW.    China Zhongyuan Engineering, China Nuclear Industry No.5 Construction Company, and Shanghai Nuclear Engineering and Research Design Institute were the contractors responsible for Unit 3 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. China National Nuclear Cooperation (CNNC) was the contractor responsible for Unit 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) supervised the work of all four Chinese contractors.  Construction of CHASNUPP-III (also known as C3 or Unit 3) commenced on May 28, 2011. CHASNUPP-III joined the nation's electricity grid system on October 15, 2016 and commenced its operations on December 6, 2016. It was officially inaugurated on December 28, 2016. Construction of CHASNUPP-IV (also known as C4 or Unit 4) started on December 18, 2011. CHASNUPP-IV was connected to nation's grid system on June 25, 2017 and it commenced its operations on September 19, 2017.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank buyer's credit loan for Units 3 and 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the buyer's credit loan agreement for Units 3 and 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. Then, on November 19, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE1-038]. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between January 1, 2021 and June 30, 2021 under the buyer's credit loan agreement for the Units 3 and 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project.

China CITIC Bank contributed $50 million to the syndicate. Bank of China contributed $994,672.71. The individual contributions of the other Chinese banks are unknown. The loan was insured (mostly likely by Sinosure) and it carried the following borrowing terms: an 8-year maturity, a 3-year grace period, a 0.35% management fee, a 0.15% commitment fee, and an annual interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (1.461% in November 2002) plus a 1.25% margin. The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $323 commercial (EPC) contract between Tehran Urban and Suburban Railway Company (TUSRC or 德黑兰城郊铁路公司) and China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC), which was signed in November 2002.

(TMAR), a Brazilian telecommunications company and subsidiary of Oi S.A. The first was a $600 million buyer's credit loan and the second was a $600 million refinancing credit agreement. Oi S.A. served as guarantor for both loans.  The purpose of the buyer's credit (captured via Project ID#59744) was to purchase equipment and services from Huawei Technologies. The original borrowing terms included a 9.5-year maturity (final maturity date: June 18, 2025), no grace period, and an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 200 basis points. Under the original buyer’s credit agreement, the principal amount was to be amortized with 14 semiannual installments taking place from April 2019 to June 2025. The purpose of the refinancing credit agreement (captured via Project ID#59611) was to help repay previous CDB loans. The original borrowing terms included a 5-year maturity (final maturity date: December 18, 2020), no grace period, and an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus 190 basis points. Under the original refinancing credit agreement, the principal amount was to be amortized with 14 semiannual installments taking place from April 2019 to December 2020.  Then, in June 2016, Oi S.A. (“Oi”) filed Brazil's largest ever bankruptcy. Consequently, the borrower was unable to meet its repayment obligations to CDB until 2023 at the earliest. After a nearly 2-year long process, creditors of Oi and several of its subsidiaries — including Telemar Norte Leste S.A. (TMAR) — approved a plan of reorganization at a creditors meeting on December 19, 2017, held in a former Olympic boxing venue on the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro, to restructure nearly $20 billion in claims, the largest corporate restructuring in the history of Latin America (and potentially any emerging market), and the first truly public Brazilian company to go through judicial restructuring since Brazil reformed its insolvency laws in 2005. After initially considering an attempted out-of-court exchange in the spring of 2016, Oi and several of its subsidiaries filed for judicial reorganization in Brazil in June 2016, and the Brazilian reorganization court accepted jurisdiction over each of the debtors, including Oi’s two Dutch finance subsidiaries, Oi Brasil Holdings Coöperatief U.A. (“Coop”) and Portugal Telecom International Finance B.V. (“PTIF”). Shortly thereafter, Oi and/ or certain other of the debtors in Brazil filed for additional protection in ancillary proceedings in New York and the United Kingdom, as well as separate proceedings in the Netherlands. In Brazil, as in most countries, the bankruptcy law respects the corporate separateness of debtors, and therefore it is the general rule that, within a corporate group restructuring, creditors’ claims will not be treated pari passu with those of creditors of other members of the corporate group. However, particularly since the Rede Energia S.A. restructuring in 2014, Brazilian courts have increasingly confirmed restructuring plans for Brazilian corporate groups that substantively consolidate creditor claims, even over the objections of creditors. Oi’s initial proposed restructuring plan, presented in September 2016, took a substantively consolidated approach. Various creditor groups opposed such substantive consolidation (albeit for different reasons), and filed motions against substantive consolidation with the restructuring court. An appeals court in Rio de Janeiro ultimately decided that the question of substantive consolidation was one that should be determined by creditors by vote at a creditors meeting. Importantly, the judge ruled that this vote should occur on an entity-by-entity basis, thereby providing the creditors of Oi and its debtor-subsidiaries with an important protection by ultimately leaving the decision on whether to accept substantive consolidation in the hands of creditors – if creditors at any particular entity were to reject substantive consolidation, it would present significant difficulties for the rest of the Oi Group to restructure on a substantively consolidated basis. If this decision is adopted more widely as precedent in Brazil, it could represent an important step in the right direction towards protecting creditors’ interest against unfettered substantive consolidation. In Oi’s case, a consensual deal with creditors was eventually reached, and creditors of each debtor entity voted in favor of substantive consolidation. Oi’s restructuring plan was approved, on a substantively consolidated basis, on December 19, 2017, after a nearly two-year process. The plan was confirmed by the Brazilian restructuring court in January 2018. Then, on June 21, 2018, Telemar Norte Leste S.A. and CDB reached an agreement to restructure $671,479,642.10 of outstanding debt under a revised set of repayment terms, including an additional 66-month grace period, a fixed interest rate of 1.75%, and a revised repayment schedule (with non-linear amortization) beginning on August 25, 2023 and ending February 25, 2035 (as captured via Project ID#96429).","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","COMMUNICATIONS",NA,"State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese Private Sector",673365341.747371,"China Development Bank provides a buyer's credit to Telemar Norte Leste SA, which is headquartered at R.

Then, on April 26, 2012, the Government of the People’s Republic of China announced that it had set up a 10 billion U.S. dollar line of credit to support cooperative projects with Central and Eastern Europe. The credit line would be partially in the form of preferential loans and would fund projects in the infrastructure, technology and green economy sectors.  Then, on May 29, 2013, the Government of the Republic of Serbia submitted a preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) application to China Eximbank for Phase 2 of the Kostolac B Power Plant Project. Then, on December 17, 2014, China Eximbank and the Government of the Republic of Serbia signed a PBC agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK NO. PBC (2014) 47 (341)] worth $608,260,000.00 for Phase 2 of the Kostolac B Power Plant Project. The loan (PBC) carried the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 2.5%, a default (penalty) interest rate of 0%, a 7 year grace period, a 20 year maturity, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee.    On March 20, 2015, the Government of the Republic of Serbia and Elektroprivreda Srbije (EPS) — a Serbian state-owned power company — signed an on-lending agreement [No. 48-1642/2012-2] for Phase 2 of the Kostolac B Power Plant Project. The proceeds from the on-lending agreement were used to finance 85% of the $715,600,000.00 cost of the commercial contract [number 127/26-13] between EPS, Termoelektrane i kopovi Kostolac d.o.o. (a project company and wholly owned subsidiary of EPS), and China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC), which was signed on November 20, 2013.    The loan’s (principal) amount outstanding was $122,456,000 as of December 31, 2018, $137,382,000 as of December 31, 2019, $175,619,000 as of December 31, 2020, $229,303,000 as of December 31, 2021, and $346,852,000 as of September 31, 2022.    Phase 2 has two sub-components. The first sub-component involves the construction of a new 350MW power generating unit (B3) at the Kostolac B Power Plant. B3 is expected to produce 2.5 billion kWh of electricity annually, increasing the total output capacity of EPS by 5%. This subcomponent was originally expected to take approximately 52 months to complete. Phase 2 also involved the expansion of the Drmno Open Cast Mine from an annual output of nine to 12 million tons of coal. The expansion of the Drmno Mine consists of a rotary excavator, eight conveyors with 12 km-long conveyor system and a spreader with the capacity of 8,500 cubic meters per hour, as well as two new substations. This subcomponent was originally expected to take approximately 47 months to complete.  CMEC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation of both components of Phase 2. The PBC that supported Phase 2 went into effect on May 25, 2015 when China Eximbank informed the borrower that it had met all of the “conditions precedent” in the loan agreement. This ‘Notification of Effectiveness’ triggered an advance payment worth 25% of the project value ($178.9 million) from EPS to CMEC in June/July 2015.   Then, an opening ceremony for the expansion of the coal mine then took place on January 23, 2017. Two construction permits for the B3 power generation unit — one for the chimney and one for the water treatment facility — were issued on July 14, 2017. Then, a formal Phase 2 commencement ceremony took place on November 20, 2017. A permit for construction of the B3 turbine, boiler, and generator was issued on April 15, 2019. Then, on May 15, 2020, CMEC successfully started concreting the boiler foundation. As of January 2021, Phase 2 implementation was still underway. The Phase II construction of the power plant B3 had a planned completion date of 2021, but the project was delayed and is now expected to be completed in late 2022.    China Eximbank also financed Phase 1 of the project (see Project ID#42549), which involved the reconstruction of 2 existing power generation units (B1 and B2) at the Kostolac B Power Plant. It is expected that, upon completion, the entire power plant — including the two upgraded 350MW units from Phase 1 (B1 and B2) and the third 350MW unit from Phase 2 (B3) — will be able to provide about one-fifth of Serbia’s total electricity supply.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient State-owned Company",673401745.456527,"This project supported the Kostolac B Power Plant, which is located on the right bank of Danube river on the outskirts of the town of Kostolac, which is located within Kostolac Urban Municipality, Pozarevac City, and Branicevo Administrative District.

According to a March 2018 tariff petition that NJHPC submitted to Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), the total project cost of 506,579 million Pakistani rupees (PKR) was to be financed according to a debt-equity-grant ratio of 79:9:11. The total amount of debt financing amounted to PKR 401,416 million, which is roughly equivalent to $3.823 billion. Additional foreign sources of debt financing included $358 million from the Islamic Development Bank, $181 million from the Saudi Fund for Development, $81 million from the OPEC Fund for International Development, and $74 million from the Kuwait Fund for Arabic Economic Development.  The 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project is a run-of-the-river project in the State of Azad Jammu and Kashmir. The power plant has four power generation units and it was designed to divert the water from river Neelum through a tunnel. The tunnel intake is at Nauseri, 41 km northeast of Muzaffarabad and the underground powerhouse was constructed at Chatter Kalas, 22 km south of Muzaffarabad. The diverted water will produce electric power by passing through the turbines and thereafter this water will be released back into the River Jhelum, about 4 km south of ChatterKalas. Upon completion, the project was expected to produce 5.15 billion units of electricity annually.  The EPC contractor for this project was a Chinese consortium known as CGGC-CMEC that consisted of China Gezhouba Group Co., Ltd. (CGGC) and China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMEC). In January 2008, a letter of commencement was issued to the EPC contractor. The implementation of the project began on February 9, 2008 and construction activities were originally expected to reach completion by October 2016. According to WAPDA, 90% of the construction works were completed by March 2018. The project was officially completed on April 13, 2018. The Neelum-Jhelum power plant delivered 590 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of electricity from unit three on July 4, 2018, 453 GWh from unit four on October 4, 2018, 331 GWh from unit two on August 27, 2018 and 314 GWh from unit one on December 28, 2018. The project was originally expected to achieve its commercial operations date (COD) by December 2018. However, it is unclear if the project achieved this goal. As of February 2021, Pakistan’s Ministry of Water Resources had still not officially communicated the final COD to the Power Division. By April 11, 2019, the project had injected 2,400 GWh of energy into the national grid.  This project was plagued by controversy. In a performance audit of the project that Pakistan’s Auditor General (AG) submitted to the parliament in February 2019, the AG concluded that ‘NJHP is an exemplary mismanaged project resulting into heavy cost and time overrun.’ The audit reported an ‘unjustified abnormal cost overrun of [PKR 389 billion]’ and losses due to non-achievement of envisaged financial benefits of PKR 237 billion. It also reported losses of PKR 30 billion of revenue and an unjustified claim of PKR 175 million rock burst and an unjustified and uneconomical deployment of tunnel boring machine that failed to achieve envisaged benefits of PKR 23.15 billion. The audit also pointed to the irregular and unjustified award of construction of contract of PKR 90.90 billion before the appointment of consultants and non-obtaining of performance guarantees worth PKR 48.8 billion resulting into suspension of foreign loans and delay in the project. Also, the AG highlighted poor performance of consultants for the project engaged at the cost of PKR 16 billion and non-recovery of PKR 9.90 billion as liquidity damages from the contractors. Other problems identified by the audit include non-achievement of financial close till the project completion, delays in land acquisition, delays in adequate power supply, frequent major design changes, non-finalization of detailed engineering design, and frequent issuance of variation orders. Transparency International Pakistan also alleged that the procurement of tunnel-boring machines (TBM), which were meant to speed up the excavation of the remaining tunnels, resulted in $74 million in kickbacks.   On July 4, 2022, when the power plant was running at its full capacity (969MW), an abnormal increase in water leakage was observed which was controlled through continuous drainage pumps and an investigation into the excessive leakage was started. On July 5, 2022, an emergency meeting was held between the project management and the project consultants team to analyze the situation and determine the root cause of excessive water leakage. It was observed that tailrace tunnel had obtained an abnormal pressure of 616m instead of the normal 600m. It was also pointed out by the project consultants that abnormal pressure of 616m in the TRT (tailrace tunnel) had been recorded which otherwise remained below 600 meter. Accordingly, to ascertain behaviour of TRT, one unit was shut down which resulted in decrease in pressure to 608m. The consultants recommended that TRT pressure should be below 604m. In this way, load was reduced gradually. Then, on July 6, 2022, it was determined that the abnormal increase in pressure and water leakages/seepage was due to blockage in TRT and considering the safety of the structure and all other equipment, the power house was shut down. Soon afterwards and after necessary preparation (lowering of bulkhead gates by Mobile Crane, functional check of dewatering pumps etc.), dewatering was started on July 10, 2022. After completion of dewatering up to the main collapse point (293m), an inspection of the tunnel was carried out. According to the findings of a report, 'It was found that tunnel is fully blocked in 42m portion (between 251m and 293m) besides other damages.' Upon submission of the report to the Prime Minister's Office, a meeting was held on July 13., 2022 in which the Prime Minister instructed the government to engage a foreign consulting firm for determine the causes of the defect and seek advice on the remedial works. A detailed ToR for consulting firms was issued by the Prime Minister's Office, which was later finalized by the inter-ministerial committee at a meeting held on July 26, 2022. Immediately after the incident, CGGC was engaged for carrying out repairs. The contractor started mobilization at the site and subsequently a contract agreement was signed with the firm on August 25, 2022. Work on the restoration of plant commenced shortly thereafter. However, in September 2022, Chinese engineers and staff reportedly abandoned the repair of the 969 MW Neelum-Jhelum hydropower facility, which faced issues related to substantial cracks in a tunnel, resulting in a shutdown of the power plant coinciding with a power crisis in the country.  The Chinese workers were reportedly facing security issues with local residents. The Government of Pakistan, at the time, rejected claims that work has stopped at the project site.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank buyer’s credit loan for the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydroelectric Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In November 2019, NJHPC CEO Mohammad Zareen testified before Pakistan's National Assembly Standing Committee on Planning and Development and noted that '[i]f revenue from the Central Power Purchase Agency (CPPA) does not commence by December 2019, the NJHPC/Wapda/GoP shall go into default due to back-to-back guarantee, apart from the NJHPC not meeting the routine maintenance expense.' Mohammad Zareen also testified that CGGC-CMEC abandoned the project after it had achieved a 99.6% completion rate and after shelling by the Indian Army at the dam site in July 2019 and October 2019. He said the Chinese contractor was not willing to return. Mohammad  Zareen said the company’s annual debt service liability amounted to Rs 50 billion and it was getting regular letters from the Economic Affairs Division (EAD) every month for the servicing of debt to external lenders. 'I will not have the funds to pay even for salaries after December [2019]', he said, adding that the Rs 100 billion raised from local banks was currently being utilized for debt servicing and salaries.  He also noted that Central Power Purchase Agency (CPPA) CPPA had not signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with NJHPC: 'The PPA between the CPPA-G and the NJHPC, drafted and cleared by the legal section of the CPPA in June 2019, was submitted to the CPPA in July 2019 for approval of invoicing of payment of energy delivered, but is not being approved.' Consequently, NJHPC was not paid for energy delivered through the end of 2019. The non-signing of the PPA between the CPPA and NJHPC resulted in a circular debt build-up of about Rs 75 billion. Then, on or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the buyer’s credit loan agreement for the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydroelectric Project. Then, on November 19, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE1-036].

The exact locational coordinates of the power plant are 31°16′08″N 36°26′52″E. It was envisaged that the plant would utilize Jordan’s vast reserves of oil shale and help reduce the country’s reliance upon imports of oil products for power generation. Upon completion, this plant was expected to consume around 10 million tons of oil shale per year and generate 470 megawatts of baseload power by 2021. The plant would reportedly generate enough power to meet 10-15% of Jordan's electricity needs (about 3.7 billion kWh). NEPCO would act as the plant’s sole offtaker. The total cost of this project was $2.11 billion and it was implemented as an independent power project (IPP) and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25.   On March 16, 2017, a consortium of four Chinese state-owned banks signed a $1.582 billion syndicated loan agreement with Attarat Power Company (APCO) — a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and project company that is owned by YTL Power International Bhd of Malaysia (45% ownership stake), Guangdong Yudean Group Co. Ltd of China (45% ownership stake), and Eesti Energia AS (Enefit) of Estonia (10% ownerships stake) — for the 554MW Attarat Oil Shale Fired Power Plant Project. The syndicated buyer’s credit loan reportedly consisted of a $594 million contribution from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (captured in Project ID#52552), a $594 million contribution from Bank of China (captured in Project ID#72499), a $244 million contribution from China Construction Bank (captured in Project ID#72500), and a $150 million contribution from China Eximbank (captured in Project ID#72502). The borrowing terms were as follows: a 15 year maturity and an annual interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (1.426% in March 2017) plus a 3% margin. Sinosure provided buyer’s credit insurance to the the borrower. An extensive security package was also provided to the lenders that covers all of the infrastructure and materials required to operate the plant, including over the valuable land concession from the Government of Jordan.   The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance an engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract that APCO signed with Guangdong Power Engineering Corporation (GPEC) — a subsidiary of China Energy Engineering Corporation — on October 31, 2014. Under the terms of this EPC contract, GPEC agreed to undertake, on a turnkey basis, the design, engineering, procurement, construction, erection, interconnection, commissioning, start-up, testing, completion, placing in operation and delivery of the oil shale fired electric generation plant. Foster Wheeler was responsible for the provision of the circulating fluidized bed boilers. Siemens was responsible for the provision of steam turbine generators. Worley Parsons was responsible or the design of the power plant. In addition to the debt financing that was used to support this project, the shareholders in APCO agreed to provide ‘base shareholder funding’ (i.e. equity investments) of up to $528 million. These equity contributions were announced on March 16, 2017 after Enefit of Estonia and Near East Investment sold a 15% equity stake in APCO to YTL Power International Bhd and a 45% equity stake in APCO to Guangdong Yudean Group Co. Ltd (see Project ID#64457). Guangdong Yudean Group Co. Ltd is a Chinese state-owned utility that is jointly owned by Guangdong Province (76% equity stake) and China Huaneng Group (24% equity stake).   As of 2017, the 554MW Attarat Oil Shale Fired Power Plant Project was the largest private sector investment and example of limited recourse financing in Jordan’s history. Upon completion, it was expected to have 554MW of gross power generation capacity and 477MW of net power generation capacity. It was expected to consist of two circulating-fluidized-bed units and draw oil shale from a nearby open cast mine. It was expected to employ 5,500 individuals (including 2,000 Chinese nationals) during the construction phase and 1,000 individuals each year after the construction phase is completed. On March 16, 2017, APCO issued a ‘notice to proceed’ to the EPC contractor (GPEC). Then, on March 20, 2017, construction began.   Project implementation was suspended for two months during the spring of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, construction resumed in May 2020. The project is ultimately expected to deliver power generation capacity in two phases: 235MW in 2020 and 235MW in 2021. APCO has entered into a 30-year agreement with NEPCO for the sale of the plant’s entire power generation capacity following its construction. The 2 x 235 MW Attarat oil shale-fired power plant project is expected to deliver capacity in two phases, 235 MW in 2H 2020 and 235 MW in 1H 2021. Unit 1 of the 2 x 235 MW Attarat oil shale-fired power plant, which also includes an open-cast mine, was synchronized with Jordan’s national grid on May 26, 2021. As of the same date, the entire project had achieved a 96% completion rate. However, the 554MW Attarat Oil Shale Fired Power Plant Project has become a source of local controversy. To facilitate repayment of the loan (and provide a financial return to its equity holder), APCO entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with National Electric Power Corporation (NEPCO), the Jordanian state-owned power utility. NEPCO agreed to serve as the sole offtaker (i.e., single buyer) and purchase all power generated by the oil shale-fired power plant in Attarat at a price of approximately $0.17 per kilowatt hour (kWh). However, NEPCO signed several other PPAs with private companies around the same time, which resulted in too much power generation capacity and not enough customers.   As of late 2021, many of APCO’s competitors were selling electricity at $0.10 per kilowatt hour (kWh), which put NEPCO between a rock and a hard place: it is contractually obligated to purchase power from APCOM at $0.17 per kWh without enough customers to whom it can resell the power.  On December 19, 2020, NEPCO and the Government of Jordan (GOJ) initiated international arbitration proceedings against APCO with respect to the PPA and the GOJ guarantee of NEPCO’s payment obligations. NEPCO and the GOJ sought declaratory judgments that (a) the $0.17 per kWh tariff is ‘grossly unfair’ and (b) NEPCO can terminate the PPA if its ‘gross unfairness’ is not addressed. APCO has insisted that its loan agreement with ICBC, China Eximbank, Bank of China, and China Construction Bank was based on an internal rate of return (IRR) calculation of 17% (which in turn is based on the $0.17 per kWh tariff) and that it won’t be able to repay its debts if the IRR and tariff rate are downwardly revised.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Commercial Bank","Other Private Sector|Other Private Sector|Chinese State-owned Company|Other Private Sector",684488865.270458,"This project involves the construction of an oil shale-fired power plant in Attarat (Attarat um Ghudran), a town located 100 km southeast of Amman.

In addition to the debt financing that was used to support this project, the shareholders in APCO agreed to provide ‘base shareholder funding’ (i.e. equity investments) of up to $528 million. These equity contributions were announced on March 16, 2017 after Enefit of Estonia and Near East Investment sold a 15% equity stake in APCO to YTL Power International Bhd and a 45% equity stake in APCO to Guangdong Yudean Group Co. Ltd (see Project ID#64457). Guangdong Yudean Group Co. Ltd is a Chinese state-owned utility that is jointly owned by Guangdong Province (76% equity stake) and China Huaneng Group (24% equity stake).   As of 2017, the 554MW Attarat Oil Shale Fired Power Plant Project was the largest private sector investment and example of limited recourse financing in Jordan’s history. Upon completion, it was expected to have 554MW of gross power generation capacity and 477MW of net power generation capacity. It was expected to consist of two circulating-fluidized-bed units and draw oil shale from a nearby open cast mine. It was expected to employ 5,500 individuals (including 2,000 Chinese nationals) during the construction phase and 1,000 individuals each year after the construction phase is completed. On March 16, 2017, APCO issued a ‘notice to proceed’ to the EPC contractor (GPEC). Then, on March 20, 2017, construction began. Project implementation was suspended for two months during the spring of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, construction resumed in May 2020.   The project is ultimately expected to deliver power generation capacity in two phases: 235MW in 2020 and 235MW in 2021. APCO has entered into a 30-year agreement with NEPCO for the sale of the plant’s entire power generation capacity following its construction. The 2 x 235 MW Attarat oil shale-fired power plant project is expected to deliver capacity in two phases, 235 MW in 2H 2020 and 235 MW in 1H 2021. Unit 1 of the 2 x 235 MW Attarat oil shale-fired power plant, which also includes an open-cast mine, was synchronized with Jordan’s national grid on May 26, 2021. As of the same date, the entire project had achieved a 96% completion rate. However, the 554MW Attarat Oil Shale Fired Power Plant Project has become a source of local controversy. To facilitate repayment of the loan (and provide a financial return to its equity holder), APCO entered into a 30-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with National Electric Power Corporation (NEPCO), the Jordanian state-owned power utility. NEPCO agreed to serve as the sole offtaker (i.e., single buyer) and purchase all power generated by the oil shale-fired power plant in Attarat at a price of approximately $0.17 per kilowatt hour (kWh). However, NEPCO signed several other PPAs with private companies around the same time, which resulted in too much power generation capacity and not enough customers. As of late 2021, many of APCO’s competitors were selling electricity at $0.10 per kilowatt hour (kWh), which put NEPCO between a rock and a hard place: it is contractually obligated to purchase power from APCOM at $0.17 per kWh without enough customers to whom it can resell the power.    On December 19, 2020, NEPCO and the Government of Jordan (GOJ) initiated international arbitration proceedings against APCO with respect to the PPA and the GOJ guarantee of NEPCO’s payment obligations. NEPCO and the GOJ sought declaratory judgments that (a) the $0.17 per kWh tariff is ‘grossly unfair’ and (b) NEPCO can terminate the PPA if its ‘gross unfairness’ is not addressed. APCO has insisted that its loan agreement with ICBC, China Eximbank, Bank of China, and China Construction Bank was based on an internal rate of return (IRR) calculation of 17% (which in turn is based on the $0.17 per kWh tariff) and that it won’t be able to repay its debts if the IRR and tariff rate are downwardly revised.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Commercial Bank","Other Private Sector|Other Private Sector|Chinese State-owned Company|Other Private Sector",684488865.270458,"This project involves the construction of an oil shale-fired power plant in Attarat (Attarat um Ghudran), a town located 100 km southeast of Amman.

Any borrowings undertaken through the facility were expected to carry a maturity of 15 years. VEB intended to on-lend the proceeds from the facility to a project company called CJSC Chek-Su.VK, which would most likely use the on-lent proceeds to finance an EPC (commercial) contract with Sinosteel.   The purpose of the Electrolytic Manganese Production Plant Project is to build a plant for the production of electrolytic manganese in the settlement of Tuim in Khakassia. Electrolytic manganese has a purity of 99.8% and is used for production of special kinds of steel and alloys. The plant would have the capacity to produce 80,000 tons per year of manganese metal, and the output would be sold mainly on the domestic market. As of 2015, Russia’s demand for manganese metal was about 60,000 tons per year. CJSC Chek-Su.VK did not expect serious objections based on environmental concerns in Tuim because the company planned to use modern Chinese technology that has minimal environmental impact; also Tuim had an old nonferrous metals plant that used to produce rolled copper but that had recently been closed, leaving the plant’s workers unemployed.   The total cost of the project was estimated to be 40 billion rubles (about $630 million). The financing of the project was to be provided by the Export-Import Bank of China in collaboration with VEB. CJSC Chek-Su.VK stated the plant would be constructed by Sinosteel and commissioned within 45 months of the financing being received. The plant in Tuim was expected to have 1,200 employees, and another 800 people would be employed in service areas related to the plant.

The independent power plant project (IPP) was located at Thar Block II, 25 kilometers from the city of Islamkot, near the village of Singharo-Bitra in the district of Tharparkar within Sindh Province. Thar Block II was a 95.5 square kilometer area of the Thar coalfield, which has total lignite reserves of 175 billion tons which can be utilized to produce 100,000 MW for over 200 years. The project will be fueled by coal supplied by Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC), which was developing a coal mine of 3.8 million tonnes per annum capacity beside the project (see Project ID#54315).   The total estimated cost of the 2 X 330 MW Engro Thar Block II Coal Power Project was $1.1 billion USD which was financed with 75% debt and 25% equity. Accordingly, the total equity requirement is $275 million. The majority of the equity investment for the project was expected to be from EPTL and its affiliates. IJGlobal reported that China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) invested $96.95 million USD (see Project ID#54316). In December 2014, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's (ICBC) Karachi Branch submitted an initial expression of interest to provide $825 million USD of debt financing for the power project. Then, a set of financing agreements were signed in Beijing on December 21, 2015 for both the power plant aspect (this project) and the mining aspect (see Project ID#54315). Under these agreements with EPTL, the 2 X 330 MW Engro Thar Block II Coal Power Project project was supported by a Pakistani rupee-denominated syndicated facility agreement from consortium of banks including: HBL, United Bank Limited, Bank Alfalah Limited, Askari Bank Limited, Soneri Bank Limited, Sindh Bank Limited, Bank of Punjab, MCB Bank Limited, Faysal Bank Limited, Pak Oman Investment Company Limited, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), National Bank of Pakistan, and Pak Brunei Investment Company Limited. The total syndicated loan is worth 17,016,000,000 Pakistan rupees.   Moreover, EPTL signed a bilateral facility agreement with National Bank of Pakistan worth 3,134,000,000 Pakistani rupees as well as Islamic facility agreements with three banks — Meezan Bank Limited, Faysal Bank Limited and Habib Bank Limited — worth 4,000,000,000 Pakistani rupees. All of these loans were repayable in 20 semi-annual installments commencing from the earlier of (i) first fixed date falling after 48 months since facility effective date and (ii) second fixed date falling after Commercial Operations Date (COD); where fixed dates are defined as first June or first December of any year and carries interest at the rate of 3 months KIBOR plus 3.5%.   On December 21, 2015, EPTL also signed a $621 million syndicated loan facility agreement with China Development Bank (CDB), China Construction Bank (CCB) and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC). The borrowing terms of the syndicated loan facility are as follows: a 14-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 4.2% margin, and a 7% Sinosure insurance premium. The Government of Pakistan also provided a sovereign guarantee. As of December 31, 2018, EPTL drew down $504,731 against this facility. China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. In April 2016, a groundbreaking ceremony was held. The project reached its commercial operation date (COD) on July 10, 2019.   However, this project has encountered a number of revenue generation, debt repayment, and financial management challenges since the power plant went into operation. In May 2022, reports emerged that the Government of Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to EPTL. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 45 billion (approximately $225 million). Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this '[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country’s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Then, in May 2023, EPTL informed the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) that it might shut down operations entirely because of a 'severe liquidity crunch' that made it challenging for EPTL to settle its liabilities with both lenders and suppliers. Its outstanding receivables from the CPPA amounted to PKR 65.5 billion at the time.

However, the face value of the GCL was eventually reduced to RMB 700,365,503. The BCL is captured via Project ID#39025. The PBC is captured via Project ID#39023. The GCL is captured via Project ID#39024.  The Government of Sri Lanka on-lent the proceeds of BCL, PBC, and GCL to Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA), the state-owned operator of major commercial ports in Sri Lanka. It was originally envisaged that SLPA would use the proceeds of the BCL, PBC, and GCL to finance 100% of the cost of a $808.1 million commercial (EPC) contract that it signed with China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) on December 31, 2010.  The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 4% margin, a 15-year maturity, a 4-year grace period, a 0.7% commitment fee, and a 0.9% management fee. The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, a 0.5% commitment fee, and a 0.5% management fee. The GCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, a 0.5% commitment fee, and a 0.5% management fee.  The GCL disbursed RMB 381,500,000 between 2012 and 2016, unknown amounts between 2017 and 2018, and RMB 318,793,357.83 in 2019. The GCL’s amount outstanding was RMB 673,428,368 as of June 30, 2022.  The PBC disbursed an unknown amount in 2012, an unknown amount in 2013, $147,249,692.27 in 2014, and $21,049,128.50 in 2015. As of December 31, 2019, it had achieved a 100% disbursement rate ($600 million out of $600 million). The PBC’s amount outstanding was $600,000,000 as of December 31, 2016 and $484,615,385 as of June 30, 2022. The BCL was cancelled in 2019 and never disbursed.  Phase II of the Hambantota Port Development Project (HPDP) envisaged the construction of a large industrial area and a shipyard facility and required the acquisition of 1,500 hectares of land. It involved the construction of a quay wall (2140 m long) to accommodate 6 container berths, oil terminal (300 meters long), yard & roads, a flyover bridge, deepening of entrance channel (450 m wide, 840 m long, 18 meter deep), 2 feeder berths, construction of an artificial island (50 Ha) & handling facilities, and excavating a new basin area.  Upon completion, it was envisaged that the port in Hambantota, deeper than the one at Colombo, would be used as a refueling and docking station for the Sri Lankan Navy. CHEC was the general EPC contractor responsible for HPDP Phase II implementation. Phase II was formally launched on November 18, 2010.  However, construction did not begin until September 16, 2012, a day before the three loan agreements were signed. Phase II was originally slated for completion in November 2015. A formal port handover ceremony took place on December 11, 2017. However, as of December 31, 2017, Phase II had still only achieved a 96% physical completion rate.  Phases I and II of the Hambantota Port Development Project (HPDP) encountered financial management problems, debt repayment challenges, and corruption allegations. Hambantota Port generated lower-than-expected container traffic and proved to be commercially nonviable under SLPA ownership. Consequently, SLPA could not service its loans to China Eximbank. In response, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited (CMPort) — a subsidiary of China Merchants Group (a Chinese state-owned enterprise) — purchased a majority ownership stake in the port and the right to operate and develop it for 99 years.  More specifically, on July 29, 2017, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited (CMPort), a subsidiary of China Merchants Group, and Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA) signed a 99-year concession agreement and formed a joint venture to operate Hambantota Port. According to the terms of the joint venture agreement, CMPort acquired an 85% stake in Hambantota International Ports Group (HIPG) and a 49.3% stake in Hambantota International Port Services (HIPS), representing about 70% of the total equity. CMPort was also granted the operating and management rights of HIPG and HIPS as well as the lease and development rights of approximately 11.5 square kilometers of land in the Hambantota port area. CMPort agreed to make a total equity investment of $1.12 billion, of which $974 million would be used to acquire the 85% stake in HIPG and $146 million would be deposited into a bank account in the name of CMPort in Sri Lanka (for the expansion of Hambantota Port and shipping-related business).  According to a July 20, 2017 Cabinet Memorandum entitled ‘Hambantota Port Concession Agreement’ (No. MPS/SEC/2017/32) that was approved by Sri Lanka’s Cabinet on August 4, 2017, when the concession agreement was signed, responsibility for repayment of the China Eximbank loans that were contracted for the construction of Hambantota Port was transferred from SLPA to the General Treasury. Given that the General Treasury was also identified as the recipient of the $974 million cash infusion from CMPort, many media outlets and commentators reported that the arrangement represented a ‘debt-for-equity’ swap.  However, the Government of Sri Lanka continued to have difficulty servicing its debts to China Eximbank for Phases I and II of the HPDP after 2017. On April 12, 2022, the Government of Sri Lanka announced a ‘pre-emptive’ sovereign debt default, noting that it would suspend debt repayments to all external creditors other than multilateral institutions. This decision to suspend external debt service affected all of the China Eximbank loans that were issued for Phases I and II of the HPDP.  Another source of controversy arose in June 2018 when the New York Times reported that $7.6 million had been transferred from a Standard Chartered Bank account controlled by China Harbor Engineering Co. (labelled ‘HPDP Phase 2’) to affiliates of President Rajapaksa’s re-election campaign. The New York Times also reported that checks worth $1.2 million (linked to the ‘HPDP Phase 2’ bank account) were delivered to President Rajapaksa’s official residence.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company",704474134.755507,"On September 17, 2012, China Eximbank and the Government of Sri Lanka signed three loan agreements for Phase II of the Hambantota Port Development Project (HPDP).

(75% equity stake) that is itself jointly owned by China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd (52.50% equity stake) and Tolaram (22.5% equity stake), Lagos State Government (20% equity stake), and the Nigerian Ports Authority (5% equity stake) — signed a concession agreement for the Lekki Deep Water Port Project. LPLEL was awarded a 45-year concession on a Build, Own, Operate and Transfer (BOOT) basis. It is responsible, under the terms of the concession agreement to develop, finance, build, operate and, at the end of the concession term, transferring the Lekki Deep Water Port (located in the Lagos Free Trade Zone) to NPA. LPLEL will earn revenues through operations of the port.   Upon completion, Lekki Port is expected to have a total of 3 container berths, 1 dry bulk berth and 3 liquid berths. The port is projected to have the capacity to handle about 5.5 million containers and estimated to generate 200,000 direct and indirect jobs in the economy. It is also expected to generate over $361 billion over the 45-year concession period with the Government of Nigeria earning about $200 billion. CMA Terminals Nigeria, a subsidiary of French shipping company CMA CGM, which it jointly owns with China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC), will operate the port once it opens in 2022, following the signing of a sub-concession agreement on September 30, 2019.  On October 23, 2019, China Development Bank (CDB) and LPLEL signed a long-term, $629 million commercial loan agreement for Phase 1 of the Lekki Deep Water Port Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower purchased a credit insurance policy from Sinosure. The proceeds of the loan (captured via Project ID#85628) were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $679 million commercial (EPC) contract with CHEC, which was signed on May 11, 2012. On the same day, CDB and Lekki Free Trade Zone Enterprise Limited signed a Sponsor Support Agreement, Completion Guarantee Agreement and the Tripartite Keep well Agreement as well as seven security documents.   The total cost of Phase 1 is $1.043 billion. CHEC made a $221,047,248 direct equity investment in Phase 1 of the project on March 30, 2020 (captured via Project ID#87054). The first, $60 million CDB loan tranche was disbursed on April 29, 2021 after Lekki Free Trade Zone Enterprise Limited had satisfied all the conditions precedent for the release of the funds. Additional debt financing was reportedly provided by Agence Francaise de Developpement (AFD), European Investment Bank, FMO, IFC, African Finance Corporation, DEG, Rand Merchant Bank, Standard Chartered, and Stanbic Bank.  CHEC is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on March 29, 2018. Phase 1 construction activities commenced on June 15, 2020. Then, in October 2020, construction of a 680 meter long quay wall commenced, with the driving of the first sets of piles underway. Speaking at the flag-off ceremony at the project site, the Chief Executive Officer of Lekki Port, Mr. Ruogang Du, said that the commencement of piling of the quay wall, which is a major phase of the construction, symbolized a significant step towards the timely delivery of the project. In late November 2020, Mr. Rotimi Amaechi, Nigeria’s Minister of Transportation directed Dr. Magdalene Ajani, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, and the legal department to document an agreement with the Lekki Port LFTZ Enterprise Ltd., to ensure that the port becomes operational in 2022. The Minister of Transportation gave this directive while inspecting the project.    In late March 2021, it was announced that the project had achieved a 48% completion rate and would begin commercial operations during the first quarter of 2023. In early May 2021, Lekki Port LFTZ Enterprise Limited announced that construction of the Lekki Deep Seaport had reached a nearly 50% completion rate. At that time, the 1,909 meter long core of the main breakwater was completed, and work on the quay wall and landside infrastructure has reached advanced stages. This milestone of the completion of the core of the main breakwater was achieved on April 29, 2021. The Managing Director, Lekki Port LFTZ Enterprise Limited, Mr. Du Ruogang, affirmed that construction would be completed as scheduled (with a planned completion date of September 2022) and a targeted commercial operations date in Q4 2022. He also affirmed that the container terminal operator – Lekki Freeport Terminal, a subsidiary of CMA/CGM — was ready to commence operations (under a bespoke sub-concession arrangement) once construction was complete. In early August 2021, it was announced that the Lekki Deep Sea Port Project was moving forward according to schedule with 58.15% of the construction works having been completed. Phase 1 was ultimately completed when a project handover certificate was issued on October 24, 2022. Upon completion, it was originally expected that Phase 1 would increase the port’s handling capacity by 1.2 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs).

Électricité du Laos (EDL) — the state corporation of Laos that owns and operates the country's electricity generation, electricity transmission and electricity distribution assets — became the effective borrower of the loan. However, it is unclear if it co-signed the PBC agreement or an on-lending agreement with the Lao Ministry of Finance. The borrowing terms of the PBC are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower was to use the proceeds from the PBC to finance 85% of the cost of a $706 million EPC contract between EDL and China National Heavy Machinery Corporation (CHMC), which was signed in late 2015.   The purpose of the project is to construct a 240MW hydropower plant with three 80MW turbines and a 74-meter high dam with water storage capacity of 107,400,000 cubic meters.

It purchased 98% of the plant's assets, saving the over 100-year-old plant from bankruptcy.  In order to support the acquisition from Železara Smederevo, the Hebei Branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) provided an EUR 27.6 million acquisition loan (captured via Project ID#95965) and an EUR 50 million working capital loan  (captured via Project ID#95935)  to Hesteel Group Company Limited. These loans were backed by a credit insurance policy from Sinosure. Then, in June 2016, Bank of China extended a $600 million loan  (captured via Project ID#67013) to Hesteel Group Company Limited to support the Zelezara Steel Mill Modernization Project.    The purpose of the project was to modernize the Zelezara Steel Mill in the city of Smederevo. Renamed Hesteel Serbia, the plant now employs over 5,000 workers, bringing local unemployment rates down to 6 percent from 18 percent. In 2017, the plant was expected to generate revenue of $800 million and a profit of $20 million. In 2018, the plant produced 1.77 million metric tons of steel, becoming Serbia’s largest exporter with sales of 750 million euros.    However, the Zelezara Steel Mill Modernization Project has also provoked local controversy. According to a November 2021 report from Reuters: “a few hundred meters from the huge furnaces of the Chinese-owned Smedrevo steel mill in central Serbia, the village of Radinac is covered in thick red dust. Cancer rates have quadrupled in under a decade, and residents want the plant to clean up or shut down. Zoran, 70, a throat cancer patient who speaks with a voice prosthesis after his larynx was removed, said residents must dry their laundry indoors and use vinegar to clean the dust from their cars. ‘Water cannot wash it off,’ he said. ‘We do not go out. We do not dare.’    According to data from the Smederevo public health body, which a watchdog called Tvrdjava obtained through a freedom of information request and shared with Reuters, the municipality of around 100,000 people reported 6,866 cancer cases in 2019, up from 1,738 in 2011. The plant says it has invested 300 million euros in technology and pollution reduction since China's biggest steelmaker, Hesteel […], bought it from the Serbian state for 46 million euros ($53 million) five years ago. ‘We are all citizens of Smederevo.... Would we be working despite pollution, against ourselves and our children?’ the plant's manager for environmental protection, Ljubica Drake, said in a statement to Reuters. Three new production facilities will significantly reduce pollution after their completion in 2022, she said. It was ‘not correct’ to conclude that higher cancer rates were caused by the plant's activities, she said, adding that the disease could be a result of NATO's bombing of Serbia in 1999 during a war in Kosovo. But activists say the plant is an example of Chinese-owned industrial firms ignoring pollution standards.    Nikola Krstic, the head of Tvrdjava, an environmental group whose name means The Fort, said an analysis of the red dust in September [2021] showed high concentration of heavy metals. ‘The air in the town is far below European standards for 120 days per year,’ he told Reuters. ‘Red dust is greasy, it sticks to lungs, makes breathing difficult.’  […] The authorities in Belgrade say they are prepared to challenge Chinese-owned companies over pollution’.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",NA,"State-owned Commercial Bank","Chinese State-owned Company",708482705.01508,"This project supported the modernization of the Zelezara (Železara) Steel Mill in the city of Smederevo.

(“Nevsun”). Under the terms of the agreement, ENAMCO agreed to purchase a 30% ownership stake in the Bisha Mining Share Company (BMSC) from Nevsun Resources Ltd., which with the Government of Eritrea’s 10% free carried interest brought ENAMCO’s total ownership stake in BMSC to 40%. Then, in November 2007, China Eximbank issued an $80 million commercial loan to the Government of Eritrea for Phase 1 of Bisha Gold Mine Project.   The proceeds of this loan were use to partially fund ENAMCO’s acquisition of a 30% ownership interest in the Bisha Gold Mine. Then, on July 12, 2010, China Eximbank issued a $60 million follow-on loan to the Government of Eritrea for Phase 2 of the Bisha Gold Mine Project. The loan agreement for Phase 2 was signed by China Eximbank President Li Ruogu and the Eritrean Minister of Finance Berhane Abrehe It is unknown how the proceeds of this loan were used. The China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 is captured in Project ID#56386 and the China Eximbank loan for Phase 2 is captured in Project ID#73371. Construction of the mine began in September 2008 and was completed by 2010. The mine began the commercial production of gold in February 22, 2011, which allowed for an early payback of gold phase capital and allowed for complete funding of both the copper and zinc phase expansions. Then, the mine transitioned from gold production to copper production in late H2 2013 and commenced commercial production of copper in December 2013 and commercial production of zinc in October 2016 following the completion of the zinc expansion project. Then, on August 31, 2018, China Construction Bank Corporation (“CCBC”) issued a binding commitment letter in which it agreed to fully underwrite a $870,000,000 (approximately C$1.1 billion) loan to Gold Mountains (H.K.)

Ltd. signed a development framework agreement with the Papua New Guinea government and foreign partner companies, Highlands Pacific Company Co Ltd and PNG stakeholders Mineral Resources Development Company (MRDC), for the development of the Ramu Nickel-Cobalt Project. In 2005, China Metallurgical Group and its partners signed a 'Master Agreement' and an 'Association Agreement' to establish a framework for financing the Ramu Nickel-Cobalt Project.   Then, on July 23, 2008, MCC Ramu NiCo Ltd. — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of MCC-JJJ Mining Development Co. — finalized a $1.4 billion financing package necessary to complete the Ramu Nickel-Cobalt Mine Project. The project was financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30. 40% of the total project cost was financed through a China Eximbank loan worth $560 million (captured in Project ID#64520) and 30% of the total project cost was financed through a 10-year, $473 million syndicated shareholder loan from MCC-JJJ Mining Development Company Ltd. The loans were to be repaid by 2017 (8 years from the commissioning date of the mine). The interest rate of the USD-denominated loan was set to LIBOR (3.119%) plus a 1.6% margin and the interest rate of the RMB-denominated loan was approximately 4.7%. The remaining project costs were financed via shareholder equity contributions.   The Ramu Nickel-Cobalt Project is located in Madang Province on the north coast of Papua New Guinea. The project comprises the Kurumbukari (“KBK”) mine and a beneficiation plant (designed to treat around 4.6 million tons of ore per annum), located on the Kurumbukari plateau, in the foothills of the Bismarck Ranges, 600-800 meters above sea level and 75 kilometers (“km”) to the southwest of the provincial capital of Madang, and the Basamuk processing plant located on the coast, approximately 55 km southeast of Madang. The KBK mine is at latitude 5° 34´ S and longitude 145° 13´ E and the Basamuk refinery is at latitude 5° 32´ S and longitude 145° 8´E. Beneficiated ore is pumped from the mine as a slurry to the plant via a 135km pipeline. The Basamuk plant is designed to produce a mixed nickel-cobalt hydroxide product containing around 32,600 tonnes nickel and 3,300 tonnes cobalt on an annual basis.   China Metallurgical Group Co Ltd was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. On November 3, 2006, a foundation laying ceremony took place. However, the implementation of the project was delayed for two years due to legal appeals over environmental issues. Also, in January 2008, local landowners staged a protest against the project Managers from China Metallurgical Group Co Ltd and four local chiefs held crisis talks in Madang town over a range of grievances. The landowners demanded that China Metallurgical Group Co Ltd stop operations until the dispute was settled. The landowners presented 18 points, complaining about their lack of participation in spin-off business, the employment of heavily armed Chinese security guards, discrimination at the work site and language barriers.   One month earlier, a former PNG health minister, Sir Peter Barter, called for an independent environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the project after discrediting the existing EIA. PNG's Lutheran head bishop, Doctor Wesley Kigasung, also warned that pollution from the mine could cause up to 80,000 sea-dependent locals to lose their livelihoods. The project was ultimately completed and handed over on December 6, 2012. In 2014, local rioting broke out against Chinese workers at the KBK mine.   Then, in February 2020, a coalition of more than 5,000 villagers and a provincial government in Papua New Guinea sued MCC Ramu NiCo Ltd., demanding not only that its Chinese owners pay restitution totaling 18 billion kina ($5.2 billion), but also that it stop dumping mine waste into the ocean and remediate the allegedly contaminated waters. Half a million people rely on the local fisheries in the Coral Triangle biodiversity hot spot, and the plaintiffs argue that their lives and food supply are at stake. The lawsuit appears to seek the highest environmental damages in the country’s history, and it relies on some of the biggest studies on the ocean dumping of mine waste ever conducted. The tipping point for the lawsuit was an August 2019 slurry spill that caught the eye of the international press as photos of crimson-red ocean waters circulated. Dead fish and a poisoned baby dolphin washed up on shore, and a man died from a “cocktail of heavy metals,” the lawsuit alleges. Madang Governor Peter Yama, who has opposed the Ramu project for years, reportedly called the spill “the worst environmental disaster in Papua New Guinea history.”","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Company","Chinese State-owned Company",721129141.081901,"The Ramu Nickel-Cobalt Project is located in Madang Province on the north coast of Papua New Guinea.

Then, on February 27, 2015, the Parliament of Uganda ratified these two loan agreements. The first loan agreement with China Eximbank, captured via Project ID#36211, is a buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement [No. 140302052015210069] worth $645,821,407.12 that was signed on February 20, 2015 with the following borrowing terms: an annual interest rate of 3.827% (LIBOR plus 3.5% margin), a 1% default (penalty) interest rate, a 15 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 0.5% management fee ($3,229,107.04), and a 0.5% commitment fee. Under the terms of the BCL, the Government to Uganda is responsible for on-lending the full amount of the loan to Uganda Electricity Generation Company Limited (UEGCL) and the Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited (UETCL). The second China Eximbank loan agreement, captured via Project ID#30919, is a preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC (2014) 46 TOTAL NO. (340)] worth $789,337,275.36 that was signed on December 18, 2014 with the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, a 0.25% management fee (worth $1,973,343.19), and a 0.25% commitment fee. The proceeds from the BCL and the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the total cost of a $1,688,421,979.39 commercial contract between the Government of Uganda’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development and Sinohydro Corporation Limited, which was signed on August 16, 2013 and amended on May 6, 2014 and May 15, 2014 (via Addendum No. 1 and Addendum No. 2). The borrower was to use the BCL proceeds to finance 38.25% of the commercial contract cost and the PBC proceeds to finance 46.75% of the commercial contract cost.   The Government of Uganda provided a sovereign guarantee for both China Eximbank loans, and the Government of Uganda was obligated under the terms of these loans to open escrow accounts with Stanbic Bank and deposit funds in the accounts over the terms of the loans to facilitate repayment and provide security in the event of default. As of June 30, 2019, the cash balance of one of these escrow (repayment reserve) accounts was UGX 87,154,247,132 ($26,146,274.13).  UMEME Ltd. became the major privately owned electricity distributor in Uganda in 2005 after winning a 20-year concession to operate UEDCL's main distribution network. It was involved as a contractual signatory to the Karuma PPA in order to safeguard the repayment mechanism and avoid potential risks of revenues being misallocated. Loan repayments to China Eximbank were to be made through electricity payments under a power purchase agreement (PPA) with UETCL and UMEME Ltd. According to the terms of the loan agreements and the PPA, UEGCL was to supply UETCL all available power capacity on “take or pay” basis, which means that UETCL was responsible for paying for all available electricity generated by the dam, and not only what was needed. However, in 2019, Uganda’s Auditor General discovered that the generation and sales licenses were in contradiction of the PPA and loan agreements because they stated that “the tariff methodology [will] be based on the energy service cost implying that the energy dispatch to UETCL will be influenced by market demand.”   According to the Government of Uganda’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the PBC achieved a 85.4% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 24 loan disbursements (worth $674,527,385.55) between 2015 and 2020: a $101,179,038 disbursement on December 24, 2015, a $16,324,648 disbursement on December 25, 2015, a $16,009,159 disbursement on December 28, 2015, a $23,583,642.35 disbursement on April 27, 2016, a $11,850,199 disbursement on July 29, 2016, a $37,208,639 disbursement on September 13, 2016, a $18,949,811 disbursement on December 15, 2016, a $8,637,526 disbursement on April 21, 2017, a $6,927,809 disbursement on June 27, 2016, a $43,705,347.25 disbursement on September 6, 2017, a $28,149,577.68 disbursement on October 18, 2017, a $12,649,419.75 disbursement on November 14, 2017, a $39,929,383.45 disbursement on December 26, 2017, a $48,155,261.48 disbursement on April 13, 2018, a $13,785,395.25 disbursement on May 31, 2018, a $65,799,750.54 disbursement on October 19, 2018, a $7,308,794.90 disbursement on December 25, 2018, a $41,827,450.63 disbursement on February 28, 2019, a $36,212,516.45 disbursement on April 29, 2019, a $13,979,022.20 disbursement on June 20, 2019, a $52,698,924.89 disbursement on November 13, 2019, a $10,010,402.52 disbursement on December 19, 2019, a $14,101,813.11 disbursement on March 20, 2020, and a $5,543,854.10 disbursement on August 18, 2020.

According to the Uganda Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development's Report on Public Debt, Grants, Guarantees and Other Financial Liabilities for Financial Year 2021/2022, as of December 31, 2021, total disbursements under the BCL amounted to $581,678,517 and the loan’s amount outstanding (including arrears) was $517,096,376.38.   On July 28, 2021, the Government of Uganda and China Eximbank signed a supplementary agreement to the BCL agreement [ID#14030205015210069A], which extended the loan's availability (disbursement) period to allow for $73,915,778.59 of undisbursed funds to be utilized by the borrower (after the original availability period expired on December 24, 2020). The supplementary agreement also specified that, if the loan fully disbursed, the borrower would be responsible for making twenty, semi-annual repayments (worth $32,291,070.36 each) between January 21, 2021 and July 21, 2030.  The 600 MW Karuma Hydropower Dam and Associated Transmission lines and Sub-stations Project., which is also known as the Karuma Hydropower Plant and Interconnection Project, will involve the installation of 6 turbines (10 million kilowatts each), which will create a total capacity of 600 MW, making it Uganda's largest power plant. After the first two turbines start generating electricity, the remaining four turbines will be turned on once per month. The project includes dams, water diversion pipes, underground power plants, and transmission lines. The purpose of the Interconnection Project is to evacuate power produced from Karuma Hydropower Plant in Northern Uganda to load centers, which include Lira and Olwiyo in Northern Uganda, and Kawanda in Central Uganda. It will involve construction of a 248km, 400kV, Double Circuit Karuma-Kawanda transmission line; a 78km, 132kV, Double Circuit Karuma-Lira Transmission Line; a 55km, 400kV, Double Circuit Karuma-Olwiyo transmission Line (which will be initially operated at 132kV); a new 400/132kV sub-station interconnecting with Karuma HPP and 400kV line bays; a new 400kV/220kV substation with two new incoming 400kV line bays to interface with the existing Kawanda 220/132kV substation; two new incoming 132kV line bays to interface with the existing Lira 132/33kV substation; and a new 132/33kV Olwiyo substation.   The EPC contractor responsible for implementation of this project was Sinohydro Corporation Limited. The construction of the dam and power station officially started on August 12, 2013. As of March 2016, about 30% of the work had been completed. In October 2016, it was estimated that about 1,000 Chinese nationals and about 5,000 Ugandans were working at the power station. As of June 2018, 56 months from the beginning of construction, an estimated 76% of the physical work had been completed. Of the 6,000 workers, 5,300 were Ugandan. As of September 2019, an estimated 95% of construction activities had been completed, which included 100% completion of the Karuma–Lira High Voltage Line, 100% of the Karuma–Kawanda High Voltage Power Line and 98% of the Karuma–Olwiyo High Voltage Line. As of December 2020, the Karuma Hydropower dam had reached a 98.7% physical progress rate, the Karuma-Kawanda transmission line had reached a 99.5% physical progress rate, the Karuma-Lira transmission line had reached a 86.4% physical progress rate, the Karuma-Olwiyo transmission line had reached a 95.5% physical progress rate, and the Karuma, Kawanda, Olwiyo, and Lira substations have reached 99.9%, 99.9%, 93% and 99% physical progress rates, respectively. The COVID-19 pandemic was considered a force major event in that it constrained manufacturing and prevented the shipping of equipment and the travel of experts to facilitate the installation and commissioning of equipment. Other project implementation challenges have included a dispute between the EPC contractor and a sub-contractor, which halted the finalization of the stringing and energizing of a 2.504 km transmission line; UMEME distribution lines without required minimum clearances at Walusi, and Wabigalo; the vandalism of tower materials; accusations of public waste and corruption; the death of a worker due to allegedly unsafe work practices; and accusations that one worker was engaged in ivory smuggling activities. The cost of the project also reportedly ballooned from $1.68 billion at least $2.2 billion.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company",724789587.521878,"The Karuma Hydroelectric Power Station is located at Karuma Falls on the Nile River in Kiryandongo District in mid-northern Uganda, 110km downstream of Lake Kyoga, and 270km from Kampala.

32192,"China (People's Republic of)","Cambodia","Asia",2010,2015,"China Eximbank provides RMB 3.53 billion overseas investment loan for 246 MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project","On January 18, 2017, China National Heavy Machinery Corporation (CHMC) and the Cambodian Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) signed a feasibility study agreement regarding the 246 MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. The feasibility report was completed in June 2007. It was conducted by two Chinese firms: China Jikan Research Institute of Engineering Investigations and Design Co., Ltd. and Powerchina Northwest Engineering Corporation Limited. The feasibility report was then reviewed in September 2007 by a group of experts organized by China Hydropower Engineering Consulting Group Co. (CHECC) — a subsidiary of China Electric Power Construction Group Co., Ltd. — and again in February 2008 by Cambodia’s MME. Then, in June 2008, China National Heavy Machinery Corporation (CHMC) and the Cambodian Government signed a build-operate and transfer (BOT) agreement regarding the 246MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project.   The 42 year agreement includes a 5-year construction period (1 year for preparation and 4 years for construction) and a 37-year operating period. In addition, an execution agreement, power purchase agreement (PPA), and BOT land lease agreement were signed by CHMC, Cambodia’s Ministry of Economy and Finance, Cambodia’s MME, and Electricité du Cambodge (EDC) — a Cambodian state-owned power company — in June 2008. On November 17, 2008, China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) issued a letter of interest, which conveyed its willingness to provide insurance for the $540 million project. Two months later, on January 12, 2009, China Eximbank issued a letter of interest, which conveyed its willingness to provide a loan for the 246 MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. Then, in August 2009, China’s National Development and Reform Commission formally approved CHMC’s investment in the 246MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project, which enabled China Eximbank to grant credit support to the project.   On June 9, 2010, China Eximbank and Cambodian Tatay Hydropower Limited (CTHL or 柬埔寨達岱水電有限公司) — a special purpose vehicle and project company that is wholly owned by another special purpose vehicle called Beijing Sanlian International Investment Co., Ltd., which in turn is owned by China National Heavy Machinery Corporation (93.13% equity stake) and CHINT Group (6.88% equity stake) — signed an overseas investment loan (境外投资贷款) agreement worth RMB 3,533,622,000 for the 246 MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project. The loan was issued in three tranches worth RMB 1,349,831,300, RMB 1,195,191,300, and RMB 988,599,400 yuan, respectively. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. The parties also signed a mortgage agreement, stipulating that CTHL would provide a mortgage guarantee for all its properties (tangible or intangible) and all rights (existing or in the future) to China Eximbank. Sinosure also provided insurance for the overseas investment loan.   The proceeds of the China Eximbank loan were to be used by the borrower to finance a commercial (EPC) contract that it signed with China Gezhouba Group Company Limited (CGGC) on February 10, 2010. The purpose of the project was to construct a hydroelectric power plant with a new reservoir (whose water surface area is 16,000,000m2 with a power density of 15.375W/m2) downstream of the Tatay River in Thma Bang District and Koh Kong Province and thereby generate power from clean renewable hydropower in Koh Kong Province and contribute to the sustainability of the Phnom Penh Power Grid. It involved the installation of 3 sets of turbine and generators (3×82MW), which amount to a total capacity of 246MW and a total net electricity supply of 857,300MWh (to be sold to the Phnom Penh Power Grid). It relied upon technology manufactured by Zhejiang Fuchunjiang Hydropower Equipments Co., Ltd in China.   The project was a diversion type hydropower station. Two dams were constructed to form a new reservoir. The concrete face rock-fill dam was located on the main stream of Tatay river and the auxiliary dam was located in Stung Kep River which is a tributary of the Tatay River. The three-opening bank spillway was located on the left bank of the Stung Kep River. The headrace power system and the river-side ground powerhouse were located at the left bank of the Tatay River; access roads to the dam crest and project site were provided on the left bank. The maximum height of the main dam located on the main stream was 110 meters, and the maximum height of the dam located on the Stung Kep River was 77 meters. A new reservoir was formed with the water surface of 16,000,000m2 and the power density is 15.375W/m2 . The designed net water head for the power generation was 188 meters. The power generated by the plant was to be routed to the 230kV O-Saom Substation though a 65km 230kV transmission line to Phnom Penh power grid. The project required the excavation of 7 million m3 of earth and 900,000 m3 of stone, for an active water storage capacity estimated at 322 m3 and an overall reservoir capacity of 439 million m3.   The project is located in Thmabang District within Koh Kong (Khétt Kaôh Kông) Province, which has central geographical coordinates at powerhouse: 103°10′11″E, 11°35′23″N; dam on Tatay River: 103°15′44″E, 11°37′46″N (i.e. powerhouse: 103.1697°E, 11.5897°N; dam on Tatay River: 103.2622°E, 11.6294°N). The dam site of the proposed project is 1.4 km upstream of the junction between Tatay River and its tributary named Stung Kep and 40km away from Koh Kong City, the capital of Koh Kong Province. China Gezhouba Group Company Limited (CGGC or 中国葛洲坝集团股份有限公司) was the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, Zhejiang Fuchunjiang Hydropower Equipment Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Zhefu Holding Group Ltd., was a subcontractor responsible for the dam’s three 82MW generators.    In June 2009, preliminary results from the project’s environmental impact assessment (EIA), conducted by Key Consultants Cambodia (KCC) on behalf of CTHL, were released at a public forum. The full EIA was completed in September 2010. Then, in February 2010, it was announced that CGGC had won the construction contract bid. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on May 21, 2009; however, construction did not begin until March 29, 2010. Then, on November 5, 2010, Mr. Li Ruogu, President of China Eximbank conducted a project site inspection. The main dam was finished before the 2011 rainy season, and the auxiliary dam and spillway capacity were completed one year later. The main dam was finished before the 2011 rainy season, and the auxiliary dam and spillway capacity were completed one year later. In 2012, the European consulting firm Pöyry accepted a two-year contract with CTHL to provide monitoring of dam engineering, design, construction, quality, materials, and safety until 2014. As of February 8, 2012, construction was reportedly 20% complete. The access tunnel was completed in February 2013. Then, on June 23, 2013, Cambodia experienced 50-year monsoonal rains, flooding the project and suspending much of the construction. CHMC quickly deployed rescue workers to move construction equipment and build dikes. By the next day, the flood was under control and the damage contained. By the fall of 2013, the main dam passed the gate-closing requirements as determined by a Chinese team of experts and reviewed by Pöyry. After approval, the gate was closed and water storage officially began on November 16, 2013. The diversion tunnels for both dams were also finished in November 2013.   The originally expected project completion date was November 30, 2013; however, the first of the dam’s three 82MW generators did not begin to produce electricity until August 13, 2014. CHMC Board Chairman and President Mr. Lu Wenjun, and Mr. Zhu Xu attended a grid connection and commissioning ceremony on August 13, 2014. By December 2015, all three 82MW generators were active and the dam was fully operational. A project acceptance and power generation ceremony took place on December 23, 2015. The ceremony was attended by both Prime Minister Hun Sen and Chinese Ambassador to Cambodia Bu Jianguo. Then, in November 2019, China Eximbank conducted an on-site, post-loan inspection. Under terms of a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA), China National Heavy Machinery Corporation (CHMC), the majority shareholder of project owner and operator CTHL’s parent company, sells the electricity generated by the power plant at 7.45 cents per kilowatt-hour to EDC, thereby generating approximately $12 million of tax revenue a year. All electric power generated by the hydropower station is sent to the Phnom Penh-Battambang transmission and distribution lines. Since operationalization, the dam’s three generators have had an average annual production capacity of 849 GW*h14 that, in 2020, represented almost 24 percent of Cambodia’s total hydropower generation (3,493 GW*h) and 10 percent of Cambodia’s total domestic electricity production (8,513 GW*h). The 246MW Stung Tatay Hydroelectric Power Plant Project qualified for Certified Emission Reduction (CER) credits via the CDM under the UNFCCC as a renewable power source. The CDM credit system projected the dam would provide an annual greenhouse gas emission reduction of 393,329 tons of CO2 equivalents. The CER credits guaranteed by the project were then sold to the Netherlands via Gazprom Marketing & Trading Singapore between September 2013 and 2020. The project was recently re-certified by Shenzhen CTI International Certification to allow the same credits to be sold to the Netherlands for the next seven years between September 2020 to August 2027.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese Private Sector|Chinese State-owned Company|Other Private Sector",727035719.138651,"The purpose of the project was to construct a hydroelectric power plant with a new reservoir (whose water surface area is 16,000,000m2 with a power density of 15.375W/m2) downstream of the Tatay River in Koh Kong Province.

The remaining contributions to the syndicated loan came from China Minsheng Bank ($371.88 million) and Ping An Bank ($371.88 million), both of which are privately-owned Chinese banks.    The loan carries a term (maturity) of up to 15 years and an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3.6% margin. As a credit enhancement, the borrower purchased a buyer’s credit insurance policy from China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure). The proceeds of this loan were to be used by the borrower to finance up to 85% of the cost of a $4,532,114,041.00 commercial (EPC) contract that it signed with CGGC-Niara — a joint venture of China Gezhouba Group Corporation (60% stake), Boreal Investments Limited (37.5% stake), and NIARA Holding (2.5% stake) — signed on June 11, 2015.

The project involves the construction of 2171 MW Caculo Cabaça Hydroelectric Power Station, which is located at the village of São Pedro da Quilemba, near the city of Dondo, in Cuanza Norte Province. This location is approximately 195 kilometers (121 mi), by road, southeast of Luanda, the capital and largest city of Angola. The project has three main components: temporary river diversion works, main construction works, and the supply of electromechanical equipment. The main dam will be 103 meters (338 ft) in height, with crest width of 553 meters (1,814 ft), creating a reservoir lake that measures 16.3 kilometers (10 mi) in length, with a surface area of 16.6 square kilometers (6 sq mi).  Upon completion, the power plant is projected to generate an average of 8,566 gigawatt-hours of electricity a year, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 7.2 million tons annually.  An official inauguration ceremony marking the beginning of construction was held on August 4, 2017.

The legal adviser for the transaction was LP and King Wood Mallesons. Deliveries of the aircraft were scheduled to begin in March 2017. Four Airbus A320s were delivered in the first half of 2017, and one Airbus 321 was delivered on July 7, 2017. A sixth Airbus was delivered on August 15, 2017.  As a consequence of the February 24, 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Western government issued a number of sanctions on the Russian aviation and airline industry. As a result, a number of leasing companies cancelled their lease agreements with Russian airliners. Despite the cancellations, Russia acted to seize the leased aircraft to maintain a fleet of air-worthy aircraft and prevent foreign currency outflows (since leasing contracts are denominated in United States dollars) in violation of the Cape Town Convention, an international treaty that stipulates the return of leased aircraft to their owners when contracts are cancelled. On March 14, 2022, after the beginning of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russia passed a law to allow foreign-registered aircraft owned by non-Russian lessors to be placed on the Russian registry, making it likely that leasing companies would be unable to recover their assets. 10 Airbus A320-214 aircraft and three Airbus A321-211 owned by AviaAM Financial Leasing China — possibly including the 16 Airbus A320 and A321 aircraft leased under the 2017 agreement to Aeroflot and/or the eight leased under another 2017 agreement to Aeroflot (Project ID#67101) — were re-registered in Russia, making it likely that ICBC Leasing would fail to recover its aircraft.","Implementation","Commercial","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE",NA,"State-owned Policy Bank",NA,749019802.063633,"CDB signed an agreement for provisions to Aeroflot Russian Airlines, headquartered in Moscow, Russia.

The loan carried the following (estimated) borrowing terms: a 17.75-year maturity, a 6.25-year grace period, and a 3.5% interest rate. VDB on-lent the proceeds of the loan to a special purpose vehicle (SPV) known as Vietnam Infrastructure Development and Finance Investment Joint Stock Company (VIDIFI) — a joint venture (JV) of Vinaconex, Vietnam Development Bank (51% ownership stake), Joint Stock Commercial Bank for Foreign Trade of Vietnam (VCB) (29% ownership stake) and a consortium consisting of Bitexco Corporation and the Saigon Investment Joint Stock Company (VCB) (20% ownership stake) — that owns and operates the expressway through a Build, Operate, and Transfer (BOT) arrangement with the Government of Vietnam. In total, VDB and VCB reportedly provided 70% and 30% of the debt financing, respectively, that VIDIFI needed to implement the $2 billion (VND 45.5 trillion) project. Other external financiers of the project included Export–Import Bank of Korea ($200 million), KfW Development Bank ($100 million), Citibank Japan, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, The Sumitomo Trust & Banking, and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UF. The Ministry of Finance (MOF) of Vietnam issued a sovereign guarantee to VIDIFI.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 105.5 km, six-lane highway that begins at the Belt Road 3 in Ha Noi, the capital city of Vietnam, runs through Hung Yen, Hai Duong, the two major provinces in northern Vietnam, and ends at Dinh Vu port in Hai Phong. It connects the existing highways at six points, enhancing access to Dinh Vu Port, the biggest seaport in the country. This project was designed as an A-grade road with a total length of 105.5 kilometres including seven grade-separated junctions, 17 large-size bridges, 25 medium-size bridges, and 22 over-bridges. A crossing was designed with six 3.75 meters-lanes for cars that can handle automobiles traveling 120 km per hour and two emergency stopping-lanes.   China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) was one of the contractors responsible for project implementation. However, several other contractors were involved. The construction contract for the project was awarded to SK C&C, the system integration subsidiary of SK Group. The company imported Korea’s cutting-edge traffic system for the project. It also installed a robust monitoring system, which collects data from tollhouse systems, vehicle detecting machines, traffic scoreboards and closed-circuit TVs, and sends it to the central management office of the expressway, enabling real-time monitoring of traffic volume on the expressway.  Meinhardt International in association with Japan Engineering Consultants provided the construction supervision services. Hadicon was engaged in conducting survey and design works for three packages of the expressway for a total length of approximately 30km. Joton was the supplier of traffic paints for the project.   A pre-feasibility study of the project was developed in 2003 by TEDI and invested by Bien Dong Project Management Unit (Bien Dong PMU). However, Bien Dong PMU could not mobilize enough investment capital for project delivery. In 2007 the Prime Minister approved the feasibility study of the project under a BOT model and VIDIFI was assigned to be the project company.

The MLFA, which is an oil prepayment facility, was designed to finance 100 projects via individual loan agreements (ILAs). The MLFA was split between a $1.0 billion phase I facility and a $1.0 billion phase II facility.  Availability of the phase II facility was subject to confirmation by the lender on or prior to the date falling five years after satisfaction of the conditions precedent to the MLFA and was made available by China Eximbank during that period.  The MLFA was a framework agreement under which the Government of Angola and China Eximbank could conclude individual buyer’s credit loan agreements (ILAs or subsidiary loan agreements) for the purpose of financing up to 90% of the contract price owing to certain contractors in respect of certain contracts. ILAs approved through the MLFA carried the following estimated borrowing terms: an interest rate of 3-month LIBOR 3 plus a 1.5% margin, a 13.75 maturity, a 1.25 year grace period, a management fee of 0.3%, and a 0.3% commitment fee.  Sonangol provided a source of collateral under the MLFA, and repayments were made with the proceeds of oil sales from Sonangol to UNIPEC (China international United Petroleum & Chemicals Co. Ltd, Sinopec group), which were deposited in an Angolan Ministry of Finance (MINFIN) account at China Eximbank.  The volume of oil to be sold to UNIPEC each month for repayment of the loan varied according to market oil prices.  Under the agreement, 70% of works have to be contracted with Chinese companies and the same proportion of construction material, equipment and labour has to be contracted in China.  Loan disbursements were made on a project-by-project basis.  Tendering, management and payments were jointly managed by the Chinese Ministry of Commerce and the Angolan Ministry of Finance (which coordinated the various Angolan line ministries responsible for supervising the projects).   The Angolan Ministry of Finance submitted the projects for tendering; China Eximbank selected Chinese candidate firms for the projects; and a joint commission made the final firm selections.

Then, on July 4, 2016, a joint venture and special purpose vehicle known as Sino-Congolaise Hydroélectrique (Sicohydro) was created by Sicomines (75% ownership stake), Gécamines (7% ownership stake), la Société Nationale d’Electricité (SNEL, 3% ownership stake), and Congo Management Sarl (COMAN, 15% ownership stake). In August 23, 2016, DRC’s Minister of Energy and Water Resources Jeannot Matadi Nenga signed a concession agreement with Sicohydro to implement the project on a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) basis. According to Moïse Ekanga Lushyma, the Executive Secretary of the Bureau for Coordination and Monitoring of the Sino-Congolese Program (BCPSC), the project was originally going to be funded with $330 million from a “mining investment loan” that was issued to Sicomines and $330 million from an “infrastructure loan” that was issued to Sicomines. However, Sicohydro ultimately contracted a $660 million commercial loan in 2016 (with a 6.1% interest rate) from China Eximbank to finance the construction of the hydroelectric power plant.   The purpose of the project is to construct a 240 MW hydroelectric power plant near the village of Busanga in Katanga Province on the Lualaba River. The project is expected upon completion to supply up to 170 MW of its 240 MW electricity production capacity to the Sicomines-managed copper mines (see more details in Project ID#450). The project also involves the construction of a ±500 kV, 13.15 km UHVDC electricity transmission line to evacuate power from the hydroelectric power plant. Once the hydroelectric power plant and transmission line are compete, the Sicomine copper mine in Kolwezi is expected to double its annual production of copper, which in principle would unlock more resources through the $2 billion ‘infrastructure loan’ from China Eximbank captured via Project ID#73145. Sinohydro Corporation Limited is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation.   In July 2015, the DRC’s Ministry of Energy and Hydraulic Resources examined the project’s feasibility study report and issued a document for its approval.  Then, in February 2016, an Environmental Certificate was issued for the project by the Congolese Environment Agency (ACE). A formal groundbreaking ceremony was held on November 6, 2016. However, construction of the dam did not begin until November 20, 2017. River closure was achieved on August 25, 2018. Construction of a ±500 kV, 13.15 km UHVDC electricity transmission line to evacuate power from Busanga dam began on May 17, 2019. The line became operational on November 6, 2020.  The hydropower station officially began water storage in May 2021, which represented a key milestone prior to power generation. By September 2021, the project as a whole had achieved a 95% completion rate. Then, in January 2022, the concrete pouring of the dam crests on the left and right banks of the hydropower station was completed. The project was originally expected to be officially commissioned on November 20, 2021. However, as of May 2022, the hydropower station had not yet been commissioned. The 240 MW Busanga Hydroelectric Power Plant Project has encountered several different problems and controversies.   On July 17, 2020, the provincial minister of the interior of Lualaba asked residents of four villages in Busanga (Kamalenge, Monga Lubuza and Wafinya) who had already received compensation to release their homes by July 29, 2020 to allow Sicohydro to dig the basins useful for the dam’s operation. Eleven civil society organizations called for a postponement of the deadline to reach a final and satisfactory compromise for all parties. The 240 MW Busanga Hydropower Plant Project has also been plagued by accusations of corruption. In 2018, reports emerged that Sicohydro had a a ""phantom"" (15%) shareholder (Congo Management Sarl, or Coman) with close ties to people in President Kabila’s entourage. Coman was represented by Norbert Nkulu, a close adviser and personal lawyer to President Kabila.  Nkulu also served as a legal representative for a port operations company majority-owned by President Kabila and his family that received $3.3 million in misappropriated public funds through its accounts at BGFIBank DRC. Coman’s director was Claudine Paony, a Congolese government officially who worked for Moïse Ekanga Lushyma, the Executive Secretary of the Bureau for Coordination and Monitoring of the Sino-Congolese Program (BCPSC). According to an investigation by The Sentry, communications at BGFIBank DRC indicate Paony received as much as $662,500 from Congo Construction Company (CCC)—a shell company created by a Chinese national names Du Wei in December 2012—in early 2014. Also, according to the Sentry, Sicomines sent three payments totaling $25 million to the bank accounts of CCC at BGFIBank DRC, and CCC then immediately routed the vast majority of these funds to companies and people associated with President Kabila. The remittance information—“contract costs,” “payment”—offered no details on the purposes of the sizable transfers, and BGFIBank DRC’s internal auditors were later unable to locate any contract underlying the payments. Citibank in New York processed at least $17 million of the money Sicomines sent to CCC.   In 2016, Sicomines wired CCC approximately $8 million. Citibank processed the transaction in New York. The bare-bones remittance information was “contract costs,” even though evidence suggests this was a fictional pretext and there was no such contract in existence. That day, CCC transferred about $7.5 million to another BGFIBank DRC client called Sud Oil and moved the remaining half a million dollars to accounts in Du Wei’s name in Hong Kong and the DRC, via ING Belgium and HSBC. The justification for the Sud Oil transfer was the purchase of “petroleum products.” Despite its name, Sud Oil was a Kabila family enterprise that no longer had any connection to the petroleum sector. BGFIBank DRC’s longtime board president Pascal Kinduelo had originally established Sud Oil as a fuel distribution firm in 2008 but reportedly divested three years later, selling off all of the company’s assets. Sud Oil gained new life in late 2013 when it was re-registered under the ownership of Kabila family member Gloria Mteyu, co-owner of BGFIBank DRC, and Aneth Lutale, Kabila’s sister-in-law and wife of BGFIBank DRC Managing Director Francis Selemani.  According to sources consulted by The Sentry, the newly registered Sud Oil was a shell company with no productive assets other than its headquarters, which were situated in a garage. Experts on the oil and gas sector in the DRC told The Sentry it was implausible the company had any activity in the sector.336 Investigations by The Sentry, Congo Research Group, and other members of the Congo Hold-up consortium reinforce the notion that Sud Oil merely served as a mechanism for moving money. These investigations show that the company received at least $85 million in funds from Congolese government institutions without any reasonable justification. In 2021, Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi authorized investigations of the Sicomines (minerals-for-infrastructure) deal and the Busanga hydroelectric power plant project.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Recipient Government Agency|Chinese State-owned Company",779330975.516588,"The purpose of the project is to construct a 240 MW hydroelectric power plant near the village of Busanga in Katanga Province on the Lualaba River.

In July 2016, OAO Yamal LNG withdrew a combined 450 million euros from the euro-dominated facilities of CDB and China Eximbank. The individual amounts withdrawn from each facility are unknown. The Yamal Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project is also being financed with a $3.069 billion loan (with a 15 year maturity) from Sberbank, a $1.023 billion loan (with a 15 year maturity) from Gazprombank, a Sinosure-insured EUR 730 million loan (with a 15 year maturity) from the Silk Road Fund (captured in Project ID#67040), an equity investment worth EUR 1.087 billion from the Silk Road Fund (captured in Project ID#67068), and an equity investment worth $5.513 billion by CNPC (captured in Project ID#67069).   The project involved the construction of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant — with 3 liquefaction trains and an annual production capacity of 16.5 million tons per annum based on the feedstock resources of the South-Tambeyskoye field — located in Sabetta at the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula. In addition to the LNG plant, the project included production at the Yuzhno-Tambeyskoye gas field, and the transport infrastructure, including the Sabetta seaport and airport. The Sabetta port is strategically located on the west bank of the Ob Bay, on the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug (YNAO). Its construction was designed to allow Novatek — Russia's second-largest (private) natural gas producer — to boost its exports to China and other Asian countries to compete with Russia’s number one gas producer Gazprom.   Technip France (France) and JGC Corporation (Japan), acting as one consortium, were the EPC contractors responsible for implementation. They are among the leading international engineering and construction companies with vast experience in front-end engineering design and execution of engineering, procurement and construction contracts for LNG plants worldwide. One of their subcontractors was China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). A groundbreaking ceremony for the Sabetta seaport was held on or around July 23, 2012; however, construction of the seaport did not begin until 2013. Despite the fact that the Russian government does not have an ownership stake in the borrowing institution (JSC Yamal LNG), when the project stalled in 2015 because of Western sanctions on Novatek, the Russian government quietly injected 150 billion rubles (approximately EUR 2.1 billion) into JSC Yamal LNG by tapping its rainy-day fund (the so-called “National Wealth Fund”). The Russian government never provided an explicit justification for the bailout, but Leonid Michelson and Gennady Timchenko are major shareholders of Novatek and personal friends of Vladimir Putin. As of April 2016, construction of the LNG plant was 65% complete. LNG production began on December 5, 2016. Then, on December 8, 2017, the commercial operation of the port and first LNG train (LNG purification facility) were launched by starting loading the first LNG carrier named after the late CEO of Total Christophe de Margerie. The loading was ceremonially launched by president Vladimir Putin in the presence of Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih. Then, in August 2018, the second production line (liquefaction train) of the LNG plant was launched. In November 2018, the third production line (liquefaction train) of the LNG plant was launched.   Yamal LNG has commissioned 15 LNG icebreaker/tanker ships to export its gas. Each icebreaker/tanker is designed to operate year-round from the Yamal peninsula and to break ice up to 2.5 meters thick. The ships are leased by Yamal LNG from four companies: Sovcomflot, one ship; MOL, three ships; Dynagas, five ships; and Teekay, six ships.  The tankers were designed in Finland by Aker Arctic Technology Inc. and built at the Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) shipyard in South Korea. The first icebreaker, Christophe de Margerie, traversed from Norway to South Korea across the Northern Sea Route in 19 days in August 2017.  When ice precludes shipping along the Northern Sea Route, then the Fluxys terminal at Zeebrugge, Belgium, will serve Russia as the LNG port for the Asia-Pacific region. Following the September 14, 2019 attack by Iran on Saudi Arabian oil fields at Khurais and Abqaiq (Biqayq in Arabic) during the 2019–2021 Persian Gulf crisis, the United States Government imposed sanctions under executive order 13846 against several companies including Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Seaman and Ship Management Company Ltd and the Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian (大連中遠海運油品運輸有限公司) which are two Cosco Shipping Company subsidiaries that are supporting LNG shipments from Sabetta. As of late September 2019, the Joint Venture TC LNG between the Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian company (50% stake) and the Canadian firm Teekay is the China LNG Shipping Ltd (CLNG) which has more than one third of Sabetta's LNG ice fleet, six ARC7 LNG tankers: Eduard Toll (Russian: «Эдуард Толль»), Rudolf Samoilovich (Russian: «Рудольф Самойлович»), Nikolay Evgenov (Russian: «Николай Евгенов»), Vladimir Voronin (Russian: «Владимир Воронин») all of which are operating, Georgy Ushakov (Russian: «Георгий Ушаков») which is going to Sabetta after sea trials, and Yakov Gakkel (Russian: «Яков Гаккель») which is under sea trials at a South Korean shipyard. Also affected were five ARC7 tankers which Dynagas will supply in a partnership between Sinotrans&CSC and CLNG (25.5% stake), as well as three ARC7 tankers from a joint venture between the Cosco subsidiary Shanghai LNG and Japan's MOL (株式会社商船三井). However, these former five and later three ARC7 tankers were not directly sanctioned but US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) rules require caution to be exercised in the former. Of the fifteen ARC7 tankers operating out of Sabetta, only Sovcomflot's Christophe de Margerie was not affected by the sanctions. Although these ships had been serviced at Honningsvåg, Norway, this was to be phased out and future LNG tanker shipments along the Northern Sea Route may occur between Murmansk and Kamchatka in Russia coastal waters.  On January 30, 2020, the United States Government lifted sanctions on Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) and its TC LNG.  There are some indications that Yamal LNG Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of its lenders. In February 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued Directive 3 Under Executive Order 14024, which prohibited U.S. persons from engaging in all transactions in, provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of greater than 14 days maturity and new equity issued by 13 Russian state-owned enterprises and entities, as well as their subsidiaries, on or after March 26, 2022. The entities included Transneft, Sberbank, AlfaBank, Credit Bank of Moscow, Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Rostelecom, RusHydro, Alrosa, Sovcomflot, and Russian Railways. Then, on March 5, 2022, the Russian Government issued Presidential Decree No. 95, which required that Russian borrowers make payments to foreign creditors from ‘unfriendly states’—including most countries that imposed sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine—in Russian rubles (irrespective of the currency of the loan), unless a permission to make direct payments in the contractual currency was granted by either the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) or Russia’s Ministry of Finance. This measure made it substantially more difficult for Russian borrowers to make timely payments on foreign- and local-currency debt to certain international creditors in their original currencies of denomination. In June 2022, the Russian Government defaulted on some of its dollar-denominated and euro-denominated debt.   The fact that at least two of OAO Yamal LNG's lenders (Sberbank and Gazprombank) faced international sanctions in 2022 and 2023 likely complicated loan repayment. Poten & Partners -- a firm that advises clients that are active in the international oil, gas and shipping markets -- noted in March 2022 that that 'latest round of sanctions has left Russian LNG sector companies and the domestic and foreign companies that provide finance and services to them struggling to assess their liabilities and exposure to counterparties. [...] Providers of the approximately [$20 billion] debt package for Yamal LNG included China Exim, CDB, Sberbank, Gazprombank, Russia’s National Wealth Fund (NWF), Russia’s ECA, Exiar, with smaller portions coming from Germany’s Euler Hermes, Sweden’s EKN, Austria’s Raiffeisen, JBIC and Intesa San Paolo. State development bank VEB also provided a US$3Bn guarantee to the project. Some of the Russian entities on the financing, including VEB, NWF and Exiar are now faced with sanctions. Novatek owns a 50.1% stake, with TotalEnergies and CNPC each holding 20% and China’s Silk Road Fund the remaining 9.9%. As the operating Yamal LNG project continues to service its loans, with a core group of lenders in Yamal LNG subject to sanctions, it will complicate arrangements. Parties who have contracts with the project such as shippers, suppliers and contractors are also potentially exposed to sanctions. It puts shareholders in a difficult position over whether to try and replace sanctioned entities. When Novatek and its partners were looking to raise funding for Yamal LNG, Russia’s annexation of Crimea forced them to makeover their financing plan. Financial advisor Societe Generale, and legal advisors White & Case and Latham & Watkins exited the project in 2014 and the financing was reworked to maximise support from Chinese and Russian lenders. It focused on using euros, Russian roubles and Chinese renminbi rather than US dollars to reduce sanctions risks. In its new form, the financing was successful, even though Novatek was subject to limited and defined US sanctions. But with the current round of restrictive measures, conditions are more challenging.'","Completion","Commercial","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Other Private Sector|Recipient Private Sector|Other Private Sector",794747156.654283,"This project involves the construction a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant located in Sabetta at the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula.

The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, an interest rate of 6-month EURIBOR (-0.274% in November 2017) plus a 2.3% margin, a 1% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.5% commitment fee, a 0.5% management fee, a 3.6% exposure fee, and a 5.8% insurance fee (i.e. 5.8% of the loan’s principal amount plus interest). The FBiH Ministry of Finance issued a sovereign guarantee in support of this loan on July 10, 2018. Sinosure also provided 15 years of buyer’s credit insurance. The sovereign guarantee issued by the FBiH Ministry of Finance runs from the expiration date of the Sinosure credit insurance policy (in 2032) until the end of the loan repayment period (in 2037).   Additionally, the borrower (EPBiH) pledged all of the property — assets and future profits — of the Tuzla Thermal Power Plant Unit 7 (also known as ‘TZ B7’) as sources of collateral to China Eximbank in the event that it could not repay the loan. However, the mortgage on the TZ B7 property only applies during a five year period: from the expiration date of the Sinosure credit insurance policy (in 2032) until the end of the loan repayment period (in 2037). The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the $722,345,000 cost of a commercial (EPC) contract between EPBiH and China Gezhouba Group Company Ltd. and China Energy Engineering Group Guangdong Electric Power Design Institute Co., Ltd (GEDI), which was signed on August 27, 2014.   The purpose of this project is to construct a new 450 MW unit at the Tuzla Thermal Power Plant (TPP) in the city of Tuzla and replace the capacity of the existing blocks 3, 4 and 5 and generate additional 270 MW thermal energy. Tuzla Thermal Power Plant (exact locational coordinates: 44°31′12″N 18°36′22″E) is a coal-fired thermal power plant in the city of Tuzla with an installed capacity of 715 MW. It is the largest power plant in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The construction of its blocks 1-6 was realized in stages from 1959 to 1978. TPP Tuzla produces electricity in thermoblocks 3 (100 MW), 4 (200 MW), 5 (200 MW), and 6 (215 MW); blocks 1 and 2 are permanently out of operation. The plant is supplied with coal from the Kreka-Banovići coal basin, the largest in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which has significant reserves of lignite and brown coal. The power plant takes cooling water from the Modrac Reservoir, the same source as much of the drinking water for Tuzla. This reservoir is fed mainly by the Turija River and the Spreča River; it already suffers from pollution caused by coal production and separation.   TPP Tuzla is operated by EPBiH, of which 90.369% of shares are owned by the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, while 9.631% are owned by private investment funds and small individual shareholders. China Gezhouba Group Company Ltd. and China Energy Engineering Group Guangdong Electric Power Design Institute Co., Ltd (GEDI) are the contractors responsible for project implementation. Construction began on June 24, 2020 after a project commencement order was issued to the consortium of Chinese firms by EPBiH.   This project has become a source of controversy and scrutiny among civic monitors. The Aarhus Resource Centre, Sarajevo and CEE Bankwatch Network filed a formal complaint against the China Eximbank-financed Tuzla 7 Coal-Fired Power Plant with the EU’s Energy Community Secretariat in September 2018. One part of the complaint was that the sovereign guarantee issued by the BiH Ministry of Finance in support of the China Eximbank loan (to a BiH power utility) underestimated the true nature of its financial liability (because the environmental permit for the Tuzla 7 Coal-Fired Power Plant only requires the project owner to use the best available techniques/technologies for desulphurisation, denitrification and efficient dust filtering as of 2006 rather than 2017). The legal limits for PM2.5 (fine particles) and SO2 pollutants were breached in Tuzla during the long winter of 2017–2018.   The Clean Air Movement—a group of citizens living in Tuzla concerned about the worsening health condition as a result of air pollution exposure—took to the streets to demand that authorities find long-term solutions to the problem. The air pollution reached its peak in 2018 and the beginning of 2019, with the air quality index reaching more than 500, which is by all standards hazardous for all people. Then, in June 2021, the FBiH government was informed by EPBiH that China Gezhouba Group Company Ltd. had requested an amendment to its commercial contract. The FBiH government responded that changing any details of the commercial contract would involve a renegotiation process and re-approval process. The amendment request came after the US-based company General Electric (GE) canceled its subcontract with China Gezhouba Group Company Ltd. The commercial contract signed by EPBiH and China Gezhouba Group Company Ltd. and GEDI on August 27, 2014 specified a list of approved subcontractors, including GE (which was to supply equipment for Unit 7). GE ultimately withdrew from the project due to pressure from the European Union, which has taken a position that does not support the construction of any coal-fired power plants. Then, in December 2021, Energy Community Secretariat reportedly determined that the sovereign guarantee for the 450MW Tuzla Thermal Power Plant Unit 7 Project was issued illegally.   Under the Energy Community Treaty, FBiH must follow EU rules on subsidies in the energy sector, which stipulate that in most cases state guarantees may only cover up to 80% of the total loan amount. The sovereign guarantee for the 450MW Tuzla Thermal Power Plant Unit 7 Project, however, covers 100% of the loan amount, plus interest and other associated costs.  Despite this constraint, the FBiH House of Representatives and House of Peoples approved the sovereign guarantee for the 450MW Tuzla Thermal Power Plant Unit 7 Project on March 7, 2019, and April 1, 2019, respectively.   On July 14, 2022, the FBiH government announced that it would reject a proposal for an alternative Chinese subcontractor for the proposed Tuzla 7 coal fired power plant. This Bosnian government’s decision was based on the analysis of Slovenian experts hired by EPBiH, who delivered their conclusions at the end of May 2022, and after the country’s State Aid Council had revoked its decision to approve a sovereign guarantee for the China Eximbank loan, four years after the Council’s initial clearance. ‘Several factors have led to this moment – the EU’s Energy Community Ministerial Council decision that found BiH to be in breach of the EU acquis – the agreements entered by EU candidate countries; the subsequent recommendations by Bosnia’s State Aid Council to end state guarantees to Chinese banks; at the global level, Chinese leadership pledged to exit construction of overseas coal-fired power plants; and the two-year construction delay of Tuzla 7 due to two major Western providers of the necessary equipment deciding to stop supporting the fossil fuel industry,’ said Boris Mrkela, Campaigner at Just Finance International.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient State-owned Company",797877329.586322,"The purpose of this project is to construct a new 450 MW unit at the Tuzla Thermal Power Plant (TPP) in the city of Tuzla.

The BCL, which was finalized after the Government of Portugal failed to fulfill its 2010 commitment to finance the bridge, carried the following borrowing terms: a maturity of 20 years, a grace period of 5 years, and an interest rate of 4%.   The Government of Mozambique agreed to collect toll revenue to repay the loan. Then, on May 30, 2012, the Government of Mozambique ratified another buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement with China Eximbank worth $72,580,000 to provide supplemental funding for the Maputo-Katembe Bridge Construction Project. (captured via Project ID#57131). The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower purchased buyer’s credit insurance from Sinosure in support of the loan.  The Maputo-Katembe Bridge Construction Project involved the construction of a 3 kilometer long and 48 meter high suspension bridge that connects the cities of Maputo and Katembe. It also involved the extension of 129 kilometer road from Katembe to the border town of Ponta do Ouro, and the upgrading of ta 63 kilometer road between Boane and Bela Vista (including bridges over the Maputo, Futi and Umbelúzi rivers).   China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) and the Maputo Development Corporation (Maputo-Sul) were the entities responsible for implementation. An official groundbreaking ceremony took place on September 20, 2012.  However, construction did not begin in earnest until June 6, 2014 and the project encountered several major problems and delays. Maputo-Sul and CRBC employed more than 3,800 local workers and 500 Chinese workers. However, local workers organized protests in 2014 due to poor working conditions and late payments of salaries. The construction of the bridge also required the resettlement of 900 families and stallholders from the Nwankakakana market. Initially, insufficient compensation was offered to the concerned parties; however, extra funds were eventually allocated for building houses for the families and remunerating stallholders. The project was originally scheduled for completion on June 25, 2018 but it was ultimately completed on November 10, 2018.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the Maputo-Katembe Bridge Construction Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2016, several credit rating agencies downgraded the Government of Mozambique to 'selective default' or 'restricted default' status, and the World Bank and the IMF re-classified Mozambique's external debt as 'in distress.'

The borrowing terms of the supplier credit (loan) are unknown. However, it is known that the loan was fully repaid as of 2016. At first, the Government of Sudan's $60 million annual debt service payments for the Khartoum Oil Refinery Construction Project were not disclosed. However, the IMF responded by conditioning its lending to the Government of Sudan upon greater transparency. By 2002, the IMF noted in its public reporting that the Government of Sudan's 'budget now fully incorporates the debt service payments for the construction of the Khartoum refinery.' The IMF also noted that 'if debt service for [the Khartoum Oil Refinery Construction Project] is not met, the CNPC has the right to lift the equivalent of crude oil in kind: nonpayment thus is not a realistic option.'     Construction began on May 26, 1998. The Khartoum refinery was put into operation on May 16, 2000. On August 28, 2003, Sudan's Energy Minister Awad Ahmed al-Jaz and Finance Minister al-Zubeir Ahmed al-Hassan signed a $350 million contract with China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) to expand the capacity of the Chinese-built oil refinery in Khartoum (苏丹喀土穆炼油厂) from 58,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 100,000 bpd. Given that the Government of Sudan held a 50% ownership stake in Khartoum Refinery Co., Ltd. at the time that the contract was signed, it was responsible for 50% of the contract cost. The first phase of the refinery expansion project was completed in 2004, and phase 2 was completed in November 2005. The expanded refinery was put into use on June 30, 2006. The expansion allowed the refinery to process more heavy crude oil, such as Fula from Block 6 (95 percent-owned by CNPC), which at the time was pumping at 30,000 bpd.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Company",NA,821266153.214489,"More detailed locational information can be found at https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/200009943","Low income","Precise","Yes"

Ltd. signed a development framework agreement with the Papua New Guinea government and foreign partner companies, Highlands Pacific Company Co Ltd and PNG stakeholders Mineral Resources Development Company (MRDC), for the development of the Ramu Nickel-Cobalt Project. In 2005, China Metallurgical Group and its partners signed a 'Master Agreement' and an 'Association Agreement' to establish a framework for financing the Ramu Nickel-Cobalt Project.   Then, on July 23, 2008, MCC Ramu NiCo Ltd. — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of MCC-JJJ Mining Development Co. — finalized a $1.4 billion financing package necessary to complete the Ramu Nickel-Cobalt Mine Project. The project was financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30. 40% of the total project cost was financed through a China Eximbank loan worth $560 million (captured via Project ID#64520) and 30% of the total project cost was financed through a 10-year, $473 million syndicated shareholder loan from MCC-JJJ Mining Development Company Ltd. The loans were to be repaid by 2017 (8 years from the commissioning date of the mine). The interest rate of the USD-denominated loan was set to LIBOR (3.119%) plus a 1.6% margin and the interest rate of the RMB-denominated loan was approximately 4.7%. The remaining project costs were financed via shareholder equity contributions.   The Ramu Nickel-Cobalt Project is located in Madang Province on the north coast of Papua New Guinea. The project comprises the Kurumbukari (“KBK”) mine and a beneficiation plant (designed to treat around 4.6 million tons of ore per annum), located on the Kurumbukari plateau, in the foothills of the Bismarck Ranges, 600-800 meters above sea level and 75 kilometers (“km”) to the southwest of the provincial capital of Madang, and the Basamuk processing plant located on the coast, approximately 55 km southeast of Madang. The KBK mine is at latitude 5° 34´ S and longitude 145° 13´ E and the Basamuk refinery is at latitude 5° 32´ S and longitude 145° 8´E. Beneficiated ore is pumped from the mine as a slurry to the plant via a 135km pipeline. The Basamuk plant is designed to produce a mixed nickel-cobalt hydroxide product containing around 32,600 tonnes nickel and 3,300 tonnes cobalt on an annual basis.   China Metallurgical Group Co Ltd was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. On November 3, 2006, a foundation laying ceremony took place. However, the implementation of the project was delayed for two years due to legal appeals over environmental issues. Also, in January 2008, local landowners staged a protest against the project Managers from China Metallurgical Group Co Ltd and four local chiefs held crisis talks in Madang town over a range of grievances. The landowners demanded that China Metallurgical Group Co Ltd stop operations until the dispute was settled. The landowners presented 18 points, complaining about their lack of participation in spin-off business, the employment of heavily armed Chinese security guards, discrimination at the work site and language barriers.   One month earlier, a former PNG health minister, Sir Peter Barter, called for an independent environmental impact assessment (EIA) of the project after discrediting the existing EIA. PNG's Lutheran head bishop, Doctor Wesley Kigasung, also warned that pollution from the mine could cause up to 80,000 sea-dependent locals to lose their livelihoods. The project was ultimately completed and handed over on December 6, 2012.  In 2014, local rioting broke out against Chinese workers at the KBK mine.   Then, in February 2020, a coalition of more than 5,000 villagers and a provincial government in Papua New Guinea sued MCC Ramu NiCo Ltd., demanding not only that its Chinese owners pay restitution totaling 18 billion kina ($5.2 billion), but also that it stop dumping mine waste into the ocean and remediate the allegedly contaminated waters. Half a million people rely on the local fisheries in the Coral Triangle biodiversity hot spot, and the plaintiffs argue that their lives and food supply are at stake. The lawsuit appears to seek the highest environmental damages in the country’s history, and it relies on some of the biggest studies on the ocean dumping of mine waste ever conducted. The tipping point for the lawsuit was an August 2019 slurry spill that caught the eye of the international press as photos of crimson-red ocean waters circulated. Dead fish and a poisoned baby dolphin washed up on shore, and a man died from a “cocktail of heavy metals,” the lawsuit alleges. Madang Governor Peter Yama, who has opposed the Ramu project for years, reportedly called the spill “the worst environmental disaster in Papua New Guinea history.""","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company",853768116.291468,"The Ramu Nickel-Cobalt Project is located in Madang Province on the north coast of Papua New Guinea.

IWH-CREC Sdn Bhd (ICSB) — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of Iskandar Waterfront Holdings Sdn BHd (IWH) [60% ownership stake] and China Railway Engineering Corp (M) Sdn Bhd (CREC) [40% ownership stake] — was the winning bidder. On December 31, 2015, 1MDB — a Malaysia state investment fund — signed a Sale and Purchase Agreement with ICSB for the sale of 60% equity in Bandar Malaysia Sdn. Bhd. (BMSB). As part of this agreement, ICSB paid a 10% (RM 741 million) deposit, which was channelled to 1MDB (the parent company of TRXC at the time) to help it meet its outstanding debt obligations. ICSB valued 100% of Bandar Malaysia's land at RM 12.35 billion, and by extension, 60% of its land at RM 7.41 billion.   Then, on June 16, 2016, Bank of China (BOC), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), and China Construction Bank (CCB) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) expressing their intent in providing a loan to ICSB for the Bandar Malaysia Development Project. During the same month, BOC, ICBC, and CCB signed a syndicated overseas investment loan agreement with ICSB worth RM 3 billion to facilitate its acquisition of a 60% equity stake in BMSB and finance associated project costs. The loan carried a 5-year maturity, but its interest rate and grace period are unknown. ICBC served as the mandated lead arranger of the syndicated loan. On June 16, 2016, CREC also agreed to make a $2 billion investment in ICSB (captured via Project ID#70527).   However, on May 3, 2017, TRXC notified ICSB that it had failed to meet the requirements of the agreement reached on December 31, 2015 and the acquisition was being terminated. TRXC refunded the RM 741 million deposit. Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance had to step in to advance the amount to TRXC as the funds were earlier used to pay 1MDB obligations. Then, in June 2017, Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance issued a Request For Proposal (RFP) for Fortune 500 companies or international real estate companies to take on the role of master developer of the Bandar Malaysia Development Project. However, a qualified company was not identified.   Then, on April 25, 2019, during the second “Belt and Road” International Cooperation Summit Forum, witnessed by the prime ministers of China and Malaysia, CREC President Zhang Zongyan and Malaysian Minister of Economic Affairs Azmin Azmin signed a framework agreement for the ‘restoration’ of the Bandar Malaysia Development Project. Two days later, on April 27, 2019, CREC announced that it would resume its participation in the acquisition of the Bandar Malaysia Development Project and maintain the original purchase price and shareholding structure. Then, on December 17, 2019, TRXC sold a 60% equity stake in BMSB to ICSB for RM 7.41 billion after the parties inked a restated shared and amended share sale agreement and shareholder agreement.  The purpose of the Bandar Malaysia project is to construct 10,000 affordable housing units on a 486-acre site and an 85-acre park for the public. The project site is located in the the heart of Kuala Lumpur at the site of Royal Malaysian Air Force base on Jalan Sg Besi. The project officially commenced on April 1, 2017. Project implementation was delayed in May 2017 due to a contractual dispute. The project was restarted in April 2019. On May 6, 2021, IWH-CREC and Malaysia's Ministry of finance jointly agreed to terminate their contract due to an inability to agree on preceding conditions for the project.

Then, on February 27, 2015, the Parliament of Uganda ratified these two loan agreements. The first loan agreement with China Eximbank, captured via Project ID#36211, is a buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement [No. 140302052015210069] worth $645,821,407.12 that was signed on February 20, 2015 with the following borrowing terms: an annual interest rate of 3.827% (LIBOR plus 3.5% margin), a 1% default (penalty) interest rate, a 15 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, a 0.5% management fee ($3,229,107.04), and a 0.5% commitment fee. Under the terms of the BCL, the Government to Uganda is responsible for on-lending the full amount of the loan to Uganda Electricity Generation Company Limited (UEGCL) and the Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited (UETCL). The second China Eximbank loan agreement, captured via Project ID#30919, is a preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC (2014) 46 TOTAL NO.

The proceeds from the BCL and the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the total cost of a $1,688,421,979.39 commercial contract between the Government of Uganda’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development and Sinohydro Corporation Limited, which was signed on August 16, 2013 and amended on May 6, 2014 and May 15, 2014 (via Addendum No. 1 and Addendum No. 2). The borrower was to use the BCL proceeds to finance 38.25% of the commercial contract cost and the PBC proceeds to finance 46.75% of the commercial contract cost.   The Government of Uganda provided a sovereign guarantee for both China Eximbank loans, and the Government of Uganda was obligated under the terms of these loans to open escrow accounts with Stanbic Bank and deposit funds in the accounts over the terms of the loans to facilitate repayment and provide security in the event of default. As of June 30, 2019, the cash balance of one of these escrow (repayment reserve) accounts was UGX 87,154,247,132 ($26,146,274.13).  UMEME Ltd. became the major privately owned electricity distributor in Uganda in 2005 after winning a 20-year concession to operate UEDCL's main distribution network. It was involved as a contractual signatory to the Karuma PPA in order to safeguard the repayment mechanism and avoid potential risks of revenues being misallocated. Loan repayments to China Eximbank were to be made through electricity payments under a power purchase agreement (PPA) with UETCL and UMEME Ltd. According to the terms of the loan agreements and the PPA, UEGCL was to supply UETCL all available power capacity on “take or pay” basis, which means that UETCL was responsible for paying for all available electricity generated by the dam, and not only what was needed. However, in 2019, Uganda’s Auditor General discovered that the generation and sales licenses were in contradiction of the PPA and loan agreements because they stated that “the tariff methodology [will] be based on the energy service cost implying that the energy dispatch to UETCL will be influenced by market demand.”   According to the Government of Uganda’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the PBC achieved a 85.4% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 24 loan disbursements (worth $674,527,385.55) between 2015 and 2020: a $101,179,038 disbursement on December 24, 2015, a $16,324,648 disbursement on December 25, 2015, a $16,009,159 disbursement on December 28, 2015, a $23,583,642.35 disbursement on April 27, 2016, a $11,850,199 disbursement on July 29, 2016, a $37,208,639 disbursement on September 13, 2016, a $18,949,811 disbursement on December 15, 2016, a $8,637,526 disbursement on April 21, 2017, a $6,927,809 disbursement on June 27, 2016, a $43,705,347.25 disbursement on September 6, 2017, a $28,149,577.68 disbursement on October 18, 2017, a $12,649,419.75 disbursement on November 14, 2017, a $39,929,383.45 disbursement on December 26, 2017, a $48,155,261.48 disbursement on April 13, 2018, a $13,785,395.25 disbursement on May 31, 2018, a $65,799,750.54 disbursement on October 19, 2018, a $7,308,794.90 disbursement on December 25, 2018, a $41,827,450.63 disbursement on February 28, 2019, a $36,212,516.45 disbursement on April 29, 2019, a $13,979,022.20 disbursement on June 20, 2019, a $52,698,924.89 disbursement on November 13, 2019, a $10,010,402.52 disbursement on December 19, 2019, a $14,101,813.11 disbursement on March 20, 2020, and a $5,543,854.10 disbursement on August 18, 2020.

According to the Uganda Ministry of Finance, Planning, and Economic Development's Report on Public Debt, Grants, Guarantees and Other Financial Liabilities for Financial Year 2021/2022, as of December 31, 2021, total disbursements under the BCL amounted to $581,678,517 and the loan’s amount outstanding (including arrears) was $517,096,376.38.   On July 28, 2021, the Government of Uganda and China Eximbank signed a supplementary agreement to the BCL agreement [ID#14030205015210069A], which extended the loan's availability (disbursement) period to allow for $73,915,778.59 of undisbursed funds to be utilized by the borrower (after the original availability period expired on December 24, 2020). The supplementary agreement also specified that, if the loan fully disbursed, the borrower would be responsible for making twenty, semi-annual repayments (worth $32,291,070.36 each) between January 21, 2021 and July 21, 2030.  The 600 MW Karuma Hydropower Dam and Associated Transmission lines and Sub-stations Project., which is also known as the Karuma Hydropower Plant and Interconnection Project, will involve the installation of 6 turbines (10 million kilowatts each), which will create a total capacity of 600 MW, making it Uganda's largest power plant. After the first two turbines start generating electricity, the remaining four turbines will be turned on once per month. The project includes dams, water diversion pipes, underground power plants, and transmission lines. The purpose of the Interconnection Project is to evacuate power produced from Karuma Hydropower Plant in Northern Uganda to load centers, which include Lira and Olwiyo in Northern Uganda, and Kawanda in Central Uganda. It will involve construction of a 248km, 400kV, Double Circuit Karuma-Kawanda transmission line; a 78km, 132kV, Double Circuit Karuma-Lira Transmission Line; a 55km, 400kV, Double Circuit Karuma-Olwiyo transmission Line (which will be initially operated at 132kV); a new 400/132kV sub-station interconnecting with Karuma HPP and 400kV line bays; a new 400kV/220kV substation with two new incoming 400kV line bays to interface with the existing Kawanda 220/132kV substation; two new incoming 132kV line bays to interface with the existing Lira 132/33kV substation; and a new 132/33kV Olwiyo substation.   The EPC contractor responsible for implementation of this project was Sinohydro Corporation Limited. The construction of the dam and power station officially started on August 12, 2013. As of March 2016, about 30% of the work had been completed. In October 2016, it was estimated that about 1,000 Chinese nationals and about 5,000 Ugandans were working at the power station. As of June 2018, 56 months from the beginning of construction, an estimated 76% of the physical work had been completed. Of the 6,000 workers, 5,300 were Ugandan. As of September 2019, an estimated 95% of construction activities had been completed, which included 100% completion of the Karuma–Lira High Voltage Line, 100% of the Karuma–Kawanda High Voltage Power Line and 98% of the Karuma–Olwiyo High Voltage Line. As of December 2020, the Karuma Hydropower dam had reached a 98.7% physical progress rate, the Karuma-Kawanda transmission line had reached a 99.5% physical progress rate, the Karuma-Lira transmission line had reached a 86.4% physical progress rate, the Karuma-Olwiyo transmission line had reached a 95.5% physical progress rate, and the Karuma, Kawanda, Olwiyo, and Lira substations have reached 99.9%, 99.9%, 93% and 99% physical progress rates, respectively. The COVID-19 pandemic was considered a force major event in that it constrained manufacturing and prevented the shipping of equipment and the travel of experts to facilitate the installation and commissioning of equipment. Other project implementation challenges have included a dispute between the EPC contractor and a sub-contractor, which halted the finalization of the stringing and energizing of a 2.504 km transmission line; UMEME distribution lines without required minimum clearances at Walusi, and Wabigalo; the vandalism of tower materials; accusations of public waste and corruption; the death of a worker due to allegedly unsafe work practices; and accusations that one worker was engaged in ivory smuggling activities. The cost of the project also reportedly ballooned from $1.68 billion at least $2.2 billion.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company",873871533.524024,"The Karuma Hydroelectric Power Station is located at Karuma Falls on the Nile River in Kiryandongo District in mid-northern Uganda, 110km downstream of Lake Kyoga, and 270km from Kampala.

(2014) 43 TOTAL NO. (337)] for the Abidjan Autonomous Port Expansion and Modernization Project. The proceeds of the loan were then on-lent to the Abidjan Autonomous Port Authority (PAA). The borrowing terms of the PBC were as follows: a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The borrower was also required to maintain a minimum cash balance of CFA 3 billion in an escrow account (accessible to the lender).  The proceeds of the PBC were used to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $933.4 million EPC contract between Abidjan Autonomous Port Authority (PAA) and China Harbour Engineering Co., Ltd. (CHEC), which was signed on January 11, 2013. The Government of Cote d'Ivoire was responsible for financing the remaining 15% of the commercial contract cost ($140,010,000). African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) also arranged an EUR 250 million syndicated bridge loan facility in 2014 for this project.  According to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), China Eximbank made 15 loan disbursements (worth CFA 459,375,056,353) between 2015 and 2020: a CFA 71,405,100,000 disbursement on September 30, 2015, a CFA 48,843,381,789 disbursement on April 30, 2016, a CFA 5,293,017,891 disbursement on June 30, 2016, a CFA 8,388,694,167 disbursement on October 31, 2016, a CFA 3,281,002,542 disbursement on November 30, 2016, a CFA 50,318,912,478 disbursement on December 31, 2016, a CFA 60,326,378,065 disbursement on December 31, 2017, a CFA 75,857,838,185 disbursement on October 31, 2018, a CFA 24,960,426,152 disbursement on May 31, 2019, a CFA 6,247,765,605 disbursement on September 30, 2019, a CFA 17,886,499,596 disbursement on October 31, 2019, a CFA 12,392,163,528 disbursement on December 31, 2019, a CFA 7,423,281,737 disbursement on March 31, 2020, a CFA 5,517,839,600 disbursement on April 30, 2010, and a CFA 61,232,755,018 disbursement on June 30, 2020.  The project involved the enlargement of the Vridi canal (a link from Abidjan to the Atlantic Ocean), the construction of a second container terminal, and a roll-on/roll-off terminal. It was expected to start in the first quarter of 2015 and reach completion by 2021.   CHEC was the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. A groundbreaking ceremony took place on October 6, 2015. The roll-on/roll-off terminal was finished at some point in 2018. On February 21, 2019, the enlargement of Vridi Canal was officially completed and handed over to the Government of Cote d'Ivoire. The project as a whole was officially completed on April 23, 2020, and a certificate of final acceptance was issued by the project owner in July 2021. However, the construction of the second container terminal was not completed until November 25, 2022. The modern container terminal, roll-on/roll-off terminal, jetties, and approach channels that were expanded and improved with financing from China Eximbank have reportedly increased the cargo handling capacity and efficiency of the port.  This project suffered from major cash flow problems. According to the Government of Côte d'Ivoire’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), PAA had payment arrears to CHEC worth CFA 186 billion (China Eximbank share: CFA 165 billion; PAA share: CFA 21 billion) as of November 14, 2017. The AMP also notes that, as of November 14, 2017, the project was generating large financial outflows but it was not expected to generate revenue until 2020. To increase PAA’s revenue-generation capacity, the Ivorian authorities considered putting in place a special tax and customs regime (in accordance with Articles 4 and 43 of the PAA statutes) from 2020 to 2035. It is unclear if they ultimately did so. The Government of Cote d'Ivoire and PAA also secured an EUR 10,641,840 agreement with Matha Capital, JP Morgan, Société Générale Paris, and Ecobank to hedge its foreign exchange (USD/CFA) risk on its outstanding debt to China Eximbank for the Abidjan Autonomous Port Expansion and Modernization Project.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Recipient Government Agency|Other Private Sector|Chinese State-owned Company",878358285.64718,"The project involved the enlargement of the Vridi canal (a link from Abidjan to the Atlantic Ocean), the construction of a second container terminal, and a roll on/roll off terminal.

The project was designed to address a power deficit in Zambia. It would involve the construction of a 140-meter high concrete-face rock fill dam (CFRD) with a length of approximately 378 meters. A surface powerhouse and five generator units would also be built. It was originally envisaged that the project would be completed by 2021 and created approximately 5,000 jobs. China Development Bank (CDB) was slated to provided financing to the project. The total cost of the project was reported to be $2 billion at the time. China’s Ministry of Commerce announced that a commencement ceremony for the project was scheduled for July 20, 2011.   However, after a change of government in 2011, Zambia’s incoming Minister of Finance questioned whether the project would be sufficiently beneficial to Zambia and whether there were adequate transparency and control mechanisms in place. He wanted a second opinion regarding the technical solutions proposed by the Chinese side. The Government of Norway was asked to review the plans and give further advice, but the Norwegian Government did not wish to be involved. The Government of Zambia nevertheless decided to ‘unpack’ the original proposal and looked for alternative funding and investors. It suspended its MOU with Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. and CADF.   However, after an open tendering process, Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. re-won the EPC contract on October 19, 2015. The project was ultimately financed as a public-private partnership (PPP) with a 85:15 debt-to-equity ratio. A special purpose vehicle called the Kafue Gorge Lower (KGL) Power Development Corporation Limited (KGLPDC) was created to manage the implementation of this PPP. It is wholly-owned by Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) Limited, a state-owned power company. Then, on November 13, 2017, Kafue Gorge Lower (KGL) Power Development Corporation Limited signed a $1,530,576,039.16 syndicated buyer’s credit facility agreement with China Eximbank and ICBC for the 750MW Kafue Gorge Lower Hydro Power Plant Construction Project. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of a commercial (EPC) contract with Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. ZESCO Limited reportedly agreed to cover the remaining 15% through an equity contribution, even though it had already made an $186 million equity investment in the project (with some of the proceeds from a $750 million Eurobond issuance in September 2012). China Eximbank’s estimated contribution to the loan is captured via Project ID#57536 and ICBC’s estimated contribution to the loan is captured via Project ID#92289. The final facility (loan) agreement included 87 loan conditions, none of which has been made public. Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. reportedly pushed to help the Government of Zambia complete all conditions before the syndicate would commit to finalizing the facility agreement. Zambia’s Ministry of Finance provided a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan and Sinosure provided a credit insurance policy (which cost the borrower approximately $100 million).   The loan had disbursed $479,000,000 as of June 21, 2018, $551,291,040 as of December 31, 2018, $887,520,697 as of December 31, 2019, $932,015,102 as of December 31, 2020, and $1,200,000,000 as of January 2020. The loan’s amount outstanding was $965,692,012 (inclusive of $16,843,994 in interest arrears) as of June 30, 2021, $981,586,149 (inclusive of $32,738,132 in interest arrears) as of June 30, 2022, and $993,836,899 (inclusive of $44,988,881 in interest arrears) as of December 31, 2022.  Construction began on January 15, 2016. However, the first loan disbursement (worth $479 million) from China Eximbank and ICBC did not occur until June 21, 2018. ZESCO Limited also hired a Norwegian private company, Norconsult, to act as its technical advisor and quality controller to ensure that Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. and other contractors honor their contractual obligations and international standards. BelFone Communications was contracted to a wireless communication system for the plant. Significant progress was made between 2016 and 2019: the North Western Province was connected to the national electricity grid following the commissioning of a 132 KV transmission line; costly diesel generation machines were decommissioned; and other transmission lines were completed to support mining projects in the region. The project had achieved a 72% completion rate by early 2020. However, the project experienced major delays in late 2019 when Sinohydro announced that it was halting its work due to the fact that it had not been paid for its services. Also, in later 2019 and early 2020, ICBC was reportedly reluctant to continue making loan disbursements due to the fact that the Government of Zambia had defaulted on its repayment obligations to several other external creditors.  Then, in January 2020, China’s Ambassador to Zambia refuted reports by Africa Confidential that the project’s lenders had suspended disbursements, resulting in a stoppage of works at the hydropower plant.  However, later that year, KGLPDC defaulted on its repayment obligations under the facility (buyer’s credit) agreement with ICBC and China Eximbank. Given that the buyer’s credit was insured by Sinosure, the EPC contractor (Sinohydro Corporation Ltd.) sought compensation through an indemnity payment. In January 2021, Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. filed an insurance claim with Sinosure, which in turn made an indemnity payment (worth $57.23 million) to Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. in May 2021.   The COVID-19 pandemic and major cost overruns also led to project implementation delays. The cost of the EPC contract with Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. reportedly increased from $1.48 billion to $2 billion, and interest payments worth $312 million during the grace period were reportedly capitalized so that the borrower would not have to make loan repayments until the power plant began generating revenue. In July 2021, during the middle of Zambia’s presidential election campaign season, one of the five turbines (Turbine Number 2) of the 750 MW Kafue Gorge Lower hydroelectric power plant was commercially commissioned and it began to supply 150 MW to the national grid. As of April 2022, ZESCO reported that two turbines at the power plant were operational and producing 300 megawatts while a third turbine was undergoing a reliability test, but there was an apparent lack of activity at the project site and neither China Eximbank nor ICBC were making any loan disbursements.  Then, in June 2022, Zambia's Energy Minister Peter Kapala announced that Kafue Gorge Lower (KGL) Power Development Corporation Limited had defaulted on its repayment obligations to China Eximbank and ICBC, and it was seeking to reschedule and restructure its outstanding debts to the Chinese creditors. He also announced that ZESCO would use internal revenues to complete the project and ensure that all turbines came online. One month later, in July 2022, China’s Ambassador to Zambia, Du Xiaohui, referred to the Kafue Gorge Lower hydroelectric power plant as a ‘a money printer made in China’ that could potentially early $1 million a day. On March 24, 2023, the fifth turbine was launched and the entire project was officially commissioned in a ceremony attended by President of Zambia Hakainde Hichilema.

The port, one of Israel's largest, was located in Ashdod, about 40 kilometers south of Tel Aviv, adjoining the mouth of the Lachish River. An Israeli state-owned enterprise (SOE), the Israel Ports & Assets Company Ltd., was responsible for overseeing the implementation of the project and eventually assuming responsibility for the property and assets constructed by PMEC.  The Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank) identifies this project on its website in a long list of other projects that it is financing with loans. However, it is not clear when China Eximbank issued a loan for this project. The face value, borrower, and borrowing terms of the loan are also unknown. China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) did issue buyer’s credit insurance for up to $948 million to the borrower. According to the Chinese Government, the monetary value of the commercial contract for the Ashdod Port Southern Terminal Construction Project was approximately $950 million (with a total contract period is 93 months).  The port was developed under a build, operate, and transfer (BOT) process as part of a 25-year concession. The port's eventual operator  was to complete the terminal development and then equip, operate, and maintain the port for the duration of the contract period. The project was divided into three subprojects: the breakwater project, the dredging project, and the wharf project. More specifically, the project involved the construction of a wharf with a total shoreline length of 2,363 meters project. It also involved the building of an 800-meter long main quay with a water depth of 17.3m, an extension of the port’s existing main breakwater by 600 meters, the building of 1,500 meters of secondary breakwaters, the dredging of the port, and the construction of storage and operating spaces.  Upon completion, it was expected that the southern terminal would the capacity to handle 1 to 2.16 million TEU (20-foot standard containers) annually. The facilities were built on reclaimed land, and were planned to handle Ultra Large Crude Carriers (ULCC) 18,000+ TEU vessels.  The port was one of the biggest investment projects in Israel, as well as one of the largest harbor construction projects contracted to a Chinese company. The southern terminal was to be Israel's first privatized port and was expected to connect Israel with international trade routes between Asia and Europe. 90% of Israeli international trade went through its seaports, but Israel lacked the capacity to handle the largest vessels; the new port was designed to accommodate these larger ships. Moreover, the new port was expected to be more competitive and efficient than Israel's existing state-controlled ports in Ashdod and Haifa. Overall, the port was expected to improve Israel's economic development and trade, as well as herald in a new era of Sino-Israeli cooperation. In addition to PMEC, China Communications Second Navigation Engineering Bureau Co., Ltd. was subcontracted to support the project implementation. Chinese state-owned construction machinery company Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group Co., Ltd. (XCMG) provided a 800t XGC800 crawler crane, as well as other construction equipment for hosting ripraps and Antifer-blocks (concrete blocks to guard against waves) for project implementation.  The cornerstone for the seaport was laid on October 28, 2014, in the presence of the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu. At the time, the port was expected to begin operations in 2021. Despite reports from Chinese sources that the project faced challenges in hydraulic engineering, the adoption of European, American, and Israeli standards, the local climate, the environmental impact, noise concerns from local residents, as well as its expansive scale. Nonetheless, CHEC-PMEC made good progress by innovating, including independently developing the world's first platform jackup rig specifically designed for offshore gravel pile construction.

KCP had the right to draw down the loan in four tranches. It drew down three tranches in 2008 in an aggregate principal amount of $1 billion. The availability period of this credit facility expired at the end of 2011. The borrowed funds bore an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 2% margin per annum until February 2013 and 6-month LIBOR plus a 4% margin per annum thereafter. CNPC provided a guarantee for the loan. The borrower also purchased credit insurance from Sinosure. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this facility was $403.9 million USD (including the capitalized interest) (₸134.3 billion KZT). The borrower was responsible for repaying the loan with profit (net income) from the Kenkiyak-Kumkol Section of the Kazakhstan-China Oil Pipeline.   JSC KazTransOil (KTO) and China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Corporation (CNODC) formed a joint venture Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) called Kazakhstan-China Pipeline LLP (KCP) on July 6, 2004, each with a 50% stake. KCP was created to construct and operate the Atasu-Alashankou Pipeline and the Kenkiyak-Kumkol Pipeline. These pipelines are two of three pipeline systems of the Kazakhstan-China Pipeline Network, which was built to create a transport corridor for the export of Kazakhstani oil to China.   The purpose of the $1.18 billion loan facility was to finance the construction the Kenkiyak–Kumkol pipeline section, which was intended to transport oil from West Kazakhstan and Aktobe oilfields. It began in Kenkiyak and ended in Kumkol. The pipeline was 794.263 km long and it had a maximum capacity of 10 million tons a year. It included relay pump stations to increase the volume of oil transported. The pipe had diameters ranging between 0.5 and 1.8 meters. The Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline passed through the Aktobe, Kyzylorda and Karaganda regions, with its oil destined for the Chinese market.   JSC OGCC KazStroyService was responsible for the construction of the 483 km section from Kenkiyak to Aralsk, while China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering Co., Ltd. (CPPE) was responsible for the construction of a 311 km section to Kumkol. Construction of the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline began on December 11, 2007. The pipeline went into operation on October 6, 2009. As of December 31, 2017, the pipeline had a throughput capacity of 9.2 million tonnes of crude oil per year. In 2017, 5.2 million tonnes of crude oil were transported through the pipeline.   Pursuant to an agreement between the KTO and CNODC, the capacity of the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline was increased from 10.0 million tonnes of crude oil per year to 20.0 million tonnes in 2015 so as to take advantage of expected increased production at Tengiz Field and Kashagan Field. Ten companies supply oil to the pipeline, which KCP has continued to own.   The Kazakhstan-China Pipeline network is comprised of three systems: (i) the Kenkiyak-Atyrau pipeline, from Kenkiyak in western Kazakhstan to Atyrau on the Caspian Sea (see Project ID#54523); (ii) the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline, from Atasu in eastern Kazakhstan to Alashankou in western China (see Project ID#39605); and (iii) the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline, from Kenkiyak to Kumkol in south Kazakhstan (see Project ID#54524).

Amid a difficult market environment, the financing was well oversubscribed, underpinned by a well-developed commercial structure designed to ensure an acceptable risk-sharing mechanism between the project and the financiers. The ECA negotiation process began in January 2009 and commercial banks were invited to submit financing proposals in July/August 2009. The debt package consisted of US$4.6 billion in commercial tranches, US$5.7 billion of direct lending from ECAs and a US$3.8 billion loan from the sponsor, ExxonMobil.   The 17 banks that participated in the syndication of the commercial tranches were ANZ, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, BNP Paribas, Calyon, China Development Bank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Crédit Industriel et Commercial de Paris, DNB Bank ASA, Intesa Sanpaolo, Mizuho Corporate Bank, National Australia Bank, Natixis, Société Générale (SG), Standard Chartered Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, UniCredit and Westpac Banking Corporation. SG and Sullivan & Cromwell were appointed financial adviser and international legal adviser in early 2008.   The commercial tranches were divided into a US$1.95 billion uncovered term loan, US$800 million term loan guaranteed by Export-Import Bank of the US (US Eximbank), US$900 million guaranteed facility by the Italian ECA Servizi Assicurativi del Commercio Estero (SACE), and a US$950 million facility insured by Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI). China Development Bank contributed US$600 million (captured via Project ID#61186) to the US$1.95 billion uncovered term loan.   The ECA facilities are split into a US$2.2 billion direct loan from the US Eximbank, US$1.8 billion term loan from Japan Bank for Inter­national Cooperation, US$1.3 billion loan from the Export-Import Bank of China (captured via Project ID#39326) and US$350 million loan from the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. All facilities have a tenor of 17 years, except for the US$1.95 billion uncovered tranche, which has a maturity of 15 years. The interest rate is unknown.   On October 4, 2013, an additional syndicated loan facility of USD 1.5 billion was committed to fund the increased project construction cost. The debt consists of a USD$600 million term loan provided by a consortium of 10 banks, including $120 million USD from China Development Bank ((captured via Project#61187), and a USD $900 million sponsor loan from ExxonMobil. The loan has a maturity length of 13 years 6 months.    The purpose of the PNG Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project was to build gas production and processing facilities, onshore and offshore pipelines and liquefaction facilities in PNG with the capacity to produce 6.6 million tons of LNG per year.  The main components of the project include (1) an LNG plant (that consists of two LNG process trains, two 160,000 cubic meter LNG storage tanks, a marine loading terminal for LNG tankers up to 215,000 cubic meters, camp facilities, including accommodation and amenities, administration office, medical center, emergency helipad and sport and recreation center); (2) the Hides Gas Conditioning Plant (HGCP); and (3) a 700 km pipeline that transports natural gas from the Hides Gas Conditioning Plant to the LNG plant.   The LNG Plant is located 20 kilometers northwest of Port Moresby, at Caution Bay on the south coast of PNG’s Central Province. The LNG process involves removing impurities and cooling the gas down to a temperature cold enough to turn it into liquid form. Once achieved, the LNG is moved to specialized storage tanks. From there, the LNG goes through a pipeline connected to the jetty where it loads onto LNG carriers. These ships then export the LNG to the international market. The operation has the capacity to produce more than 8.3 million tonnes of LNG annually, an increase of 20 percent from the original design specification of 6.9 million tonnes per annum (MTA).   Condensate, a low-density mixture of hydrocarbon liquids recovered through the gas liquefaction process, is also stored and loaded onto tankers for export at the LNG Plant. The Hides Gas Conditioning Plant (HGCP) is located just outside of the township of Hides in PNG’s Hela Province. The plant processes up to 1 billion standard cubic feet of gas gathered from eight wells each day. At the plant, gas, condensate and water are separated and treated before being sent via separate pipelines to other facilities in PNG for further handling.The gas is transported along a 700-kilometre-long pipeline to the LNG Plant near Port Moresby where it is converted into liquid form, ready for shipping. Around 30,000 barrels of condensate is also produced at the Plant daily. After separation, the condensate is directed along its own pipeline to the Kutubu Central Processing Facility and later the Kumul terminal for export.   These production demands are met by more than 450 production staff who work around the clock every day of the year. Conditioned gas is transported from the Hides Gas Conditioning Plant (HGCP) in the Highlands to the LNG Plant just outside of Port Moresby via a state-of-the-art 700-kilometre-long pipeline. The pipeline includes an onshore and an offshore portion. The onshore section of pipe has a diameter between 32 and 34 inches and is buried one metre below ground. It travels a distance of 290 kilometers from the HGCP all the way down to the Omati River. The offshore section of pipe joins the onshore section at the Omati River and extends a further 407 kilometers to the LNG Plant. The offshore segment travels approximately 24 kilometers past Goaribari Island to the open sea, then across the Gulf of Papua to the Caution Bay landfall at the LNG Plant.   ExxonMobil PNG Limited, a subsidiary of ExxonMobil, is the is the entity responsible for operating the PNG Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project. In 2008, the initial PNG LNG Project partners signed a joint operating agreement. In that same year, an independent Economic Impact Study was commissioned and showed that the Project would have a significant impact on the GDP of Papua New Guinea, in addition to other benefits such as employment and business opportunities. Then, on Mary 22, 2008, the project venture participants and the the Government of Papua New Guinea formally signed the Gas Agreement, which established the fiscal regime and legal framework by which the PNG LNG Project is to be regulated throughout its lifetime and set the terms and mechanism for State equity participation in the Project. Following this, it was announced that the project would enter Front End Engineering and Design (FEED).   Between December 2009 and March 2010, sales and marketing agreements for the gas were signed with four major customers. An Environmental Impact Statement, which draws upon 26 supporting studies and took two years to complete, was approved by the PNG Government in October 2009. This documented the many rigorous commitments and measures the project would take to manage environmental risks.   On December 8, 2009 the project venture participants approved the project, paving the way for construction to begin. This was supported by the completion of financing arrangements with lenders in March 2010. Engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts were approved in late 2009 and in early 2010 construction work began. On or around April 29, 2014, the PNG LNG Project started production of liquefied natural gas ahead of schedule. Then, on May 25, 2014, the first shipment of liquefied natural gas from the PNG LNG Project was delivered by the Spirit of Hela to the Tokyo Electric Power Co. Inc. (TEPCO) in Japan. Chinese state-owned oil company, Sinopec, also signed an agreement (on December 3, 2019), with ExxonMobil to purchase 2 million tons of LNG annually from the PNG LNG project.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Other Private Sector",901206028.964875,"The purpose of the PNG Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project was to build gas production and processing facilities, onshore and offshore pipelines and liquefaction facilities in PNG with the capacity to produce 6.6 million tons of LNG per year.

Consequently, the SLPA commissioned at its own cost an ‘initial technical feasibility study’ in April 2010 for the reclamation of land south of the new breakwater. Around June 2010, an environmental impact assessment (EIA) study was commissioned by SLPA also at its own cost through the University of Moratuwa (UoM) for a reclamation area of 200 hectares. In October 2010, Sri Lanka’s Urban Development Authority (UDA) completed a master plan study based on the initial technical feasibility study and submitted a project proposal to the SLPA for consideration. Then, in April 2011, based on an unsolicited concept proposal submitted by China Communications Construction Company, Ltd. (CCCC), the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) decided to not to commit public funds to construct the CPC Project and proceeded to negotiate with CCCC to implement the project entirely as a foreign direct investment, with no financial guarantees by the GOSL on the investment.

On the same day, China Development Bank agreed in principle to provide an $805 million commercial loan for the project and the project’s construction works were ceremonially inaugurated in the presence of the President of the People’s Republic of China and the President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka (during the Chinese President’s State visit to Sri Lanka).   The Colombo Port City (CPC) Project is being implemented on a public-private partnership (PPP) and Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) basis and financed according to a 70:30 debt-to-equity ratio. The $1.396 billion project is divided into two phases: the first phase investment was expected to cost $1.150 billion and the second phase investment was expected cost $246 million. On May 12, 2017, China Development Bank provided a $805 million loan to CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt.) Ltd. for the first phase of the project, or roughly 70% of the total cost of the first phase project of the project. The loan carries a 10-year maturity and a 3-year grace period. No sovereign guarantee was provided by the central government in support of the loan. As of September 2018, CDB had disbursed RMB 1.964 billion in support of Phase 1 of the Colombo Port City (CPC) Project.  The purpose of the phase 1 is to construct a 269-hectare artificial island and related structures. The project also involves the creation of a 5,325 meters-long breakwater that has a geometrically closed core partially consisting of sand material, rock and interlocking concrete “pods” weighing from 17 tons to 22 tons and placed in predefined lozenge-shaped grids. Upon completion, the artificial island consists of 71 million square meters of sand, with an average reclamation thickness of 20 meters. Twelve types of rock material are being used, obtained from 20 quarries located about 50 km away.    CCCC-FHDI Engineering Co., Ltd. is responsible for project design. China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. The project’s first phase officially commenced on September 16, 2014. Its originally planned completion date was April 2020, but construction was suspended due to a change of government in March 2015. Construction then resumed in August 2016.

The commercial contract was financed by a $381,467,000 million export seller's credit agreement between China Eximbank and Harbin Power Equipment Company (HPEC). It appears that HPEC then on-lent the proceeds of the loan to the Government of Sudan. The borrowing terms that applied to the export seller's credit agreement and the on-lending agreement are unknown.  The purpose of this project was to evacuate power from the Merowe Hydroelectric Dam, which was also financed by a $608 million China Eximbank loan (as captured via Project ID#178). It involved the construction of 1,776 kilometers of transmission lines and seven substations. More specifically, the project involved the construction of (1) two 500kv parallel transmission lines from the Merowe Hydroelectric Power Plant to Khartoum, (2) two 500/200kv sub-stations in Omdurman and Khartoum North, (3) a 38 km, 500kv transmission line between the Omdurman and Khartoum North substations, (4) the extension of 240 km, 500kv transmission line to Atbara, (5) a 500/200kv substation in Atbara, (6) a 455 km, 220kv, transmission line from Atbara to Port Sudan, (7) 220/110kv substation in Port Sudan, (8) a 310 km, 220kv transmission line from Merowe Dam to Dongola, and (9) three 220/33kv sub-stations in Merowe, Debba and Dongola.  The contractors responsible for project implementation included HPEC, China International Water and Electric Corporation (CWE), China Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Corporation (CWHEC or Sinohydro), and Jilin Province Power Transmission and Substation Project Company. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on April 9, 2005 but the project did not enter the installation phase until January 31, 2006. The largest substation was completed on April 13, 2009.  There are some indications that the loan issued for the Merowe Hydroelectric Dam Transmission Lines and Substations Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis lender expectations. According to Sudan’s Finance Minister Ali Mahmood Abdel-Rasool, China Eximbank suspended its financing for 11 projects in Sudan following the secession of South Sudan in July 2011, which triggered a major loss of oil revenue (a key source of collateral for China Eximbank loans). Ali Mahmood Abdel-Rasool said at the time that the Government of Sudan had previously pledged oil revenues (worth 120,000 barrels per day) to China Eximbank as a source of collateral. Then, on February 18, 2012, the Chinese Government announced that it had agreed to reschedule the outstanding debt obligations of the Government of Sudan by extending loan repayment periods by 5 years (as captured via Project ID#30421). According to the External Debt Unit of the Central Bank of Sudan, the Government of Sudan's total arrears to Chinese creditors amounted to $3.864 billion ($2.608 billion in principal, $1.129 billion in interest, and $127 million in penalty interest) as of March 31, 2022.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Government Agency|Recipient Government Agency|Recipient State-owned Company",929277926.850979,"The Merowe Hydroelectric Dam Transmission Lines and Substations Project involved the construction of 1,776 kilometers of electricity transmission lines and seven electricity substations.

(20% ownership stake), and China's CNPC (20% ownership stake) and Silk Road Fund (9.9% ownership stake) — for the Yamal Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project. The facility agreement was amended on April 29, 2016. The financing from CDB and China Eximbank is part of the project finance package totaling the equivalent of $18.4 billion.  The total cost of the project is approximately $36 billion and it is being financed with a mix of debt and equity. The project reached financial close with CDB and China Eximbank in June 2016.   CDB issued both euro-denominated and RMB-denominated loans in support of this project. The euro-denominated loan tranche (captured in Project ID#67064) was worth EUR 5,057,800,000 and its interest rate was EURIBOR (-0.141%, April 2016) plus 330 basis points during the pre-completion stage and EURIBOR plus 355 basis points during the post-completion stage.

In July 2016, OAO Yamal LNG withdrew a combined 450 million euros from the euro-dominated facilities of CDB and China Eximbank. The individual amounts withdrawn from each facility are unknown. The Yamal Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project is also being financed with a $3.069 billion loan (with a 15 year maturity) from Sberbank, a $1.023 billion loan (with a 15 year maturity) from Gazprombank, a Sinosure-insured EUR 730 million loan (with a 15 year maturity) from the Silk Road Fund (captured in Project ID#67040), an equity investment worth EUR 1.087 billion from the Silk Road Fund (captured in Project ID#67068), and an equity investment worth $5.513 billion by CNPC (captured in Project ID#67069).   The project involved the construction of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant — with 3 liquefaction trains and an annual production capacity of 16.5 million tons per annum based on the feedstock resources of the South-Tambeyskoye field — located in Sabetta at the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula. In addition to the LNG plant, the project included production at the Yuzhno-Tambeyskoye gas field, and the transport infrastructure, including the Sabetta seaport and airport. The Sabetta port is strategically located on the west bank of the Ob Bay, on the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug (YNAO). Its construction was designed to allow Novatek — Russia's second-largest (private) natural gas producer — to boost its exports to China and other Asian countries to compete with Russia’s number one gas producer Gazprom.   Technip France (France) and JGC Corporation (Japan), acting as one consortium, were the EPC contractors responsible for implementation. They are among the leading international engineering and construction companies with vast experience in front-end engineering design and execution of engineering, procurement and construction contracts for LNG plants worldwide. One of their subcontractors was China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). A groundbreaking ceremony for the Sabetta seaport was held on or around July 23, 2012; however, construction of the seaport did not begin until 2013. Despite the fact that the Russian government does not have an ownership stake in the borrowing institution (JSC Yamal LNG), when the project stalled in 2015 because of Western sanctions on Novatek, the Russian government quietly injected 150 billion rubles (approximately EUR 2.1 billion) into JSC Yamal LNG by tapping its rainy-day fund (the so-called “National Wealth Fund”). The Russian government never provided an explicit justification for the bailout, but Leonid Michelson and Gennady Timchenko are major shareholders of Novatek and personal friends of Vladimir Putin. As of April 2016, construction of the LNG plant was 65% complete. LNG production began on December 5, 2016. Then, on December 8, 2017, the commercial operation of the port and first LNG train (LNG purification facility) were launched by starting loading the first LNG carrier named after the late CEO of Total Christophe de Margerie. The loading was ceremonially launched by president Vladimir Putin in the presence of Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih. Then, in August 2018, the second production line (liquefaction train) of the LNG plant was launched. In November 2018, the third production line (liquefaction train) of the LNG plant was launched.   Yamal LNG has commissioned 15 LNG icebreaker/tanker ships to export its gas. Each icebreaker/tanker is designed to operate year-round from the Yamal peninsula and to break ice up to 2.5 meters thick. The ships are leased by Yamal LNG from four companies: Sovcomflot, one ship; MOL, three ships; Dynagas, five ships; and Teekay, six ships.  The tankers were designed in Finland by Aker Arctic Technology Inc. and built at the Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) shipyard in South Korea. The first icebreaker, Christophe de Margerie, traversed from Norway to South Korea across the Northern Sea Route in 19 days in August 2017.  When ice precludes shipping along the Northern Sea Route, then the Fluxys terminal at Zeebrugge, Belgium, will serve Russia as the LNG port for the Asia-Pacific region. Following the September 14, 2019 attack by Iran on Saudi Arabian oil fields at Khurais and Abqaiq (Biqayq in Arabic) during the 2019–2021 Persian Gulf crisis, the United States Government imposed sanctions under executive order 13846 against several companies including Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Seaman and Ship Management Company Ltd and the Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian (大連中遠海運油品運輸有限公司) which are two Cosco Shipping Company subsidiaries that are supporting LNG shipments from Sabetta. As of late September 2019, the Joint Venture TC LNG between the Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian company (50% stake) and the Canadian firm Teekay is the China LNG Shipping Ltd (CLNG) which has more than one third of Sabetta's LNG ice fleet, six ARC7 LNG tankers: Eduard Toll (Russian: «Эдуард Толль»), Rudolf Samoilovich (Russian: «Рудольф Самойлович»), Nikolay Evgenov (Russian: «Николай Евгенов»), Vladimir Voronin (Russian: «Владимир Воронин») all of which are operating, Georgy Ushakov (Russian: «Георгий Ушаков») which is going to Sabetta after sea trials, and Yakov Gakkel (Russian: «Яков Гаккель») which is under sea trials at a South Korean shipyard. Also affected were five ARC7 tankers which Dynagas will supply in a partnership between Sinotrans&CSC and CLNG (25.5% stake), as well as three ARC7 tankers from a joint venture between the Cosco subsidiary Shanghai LNG and Japan's MOL (株式会社商船三井). However, these former five and later three ARC7 tankers were not directly sanctioned but US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) rules require caution to be exercised in the former. Of the fifteen ARC7 tankers operating out of Sabetta, only Sovcomflot's Christophe de Margerie was not affected by the sanctions. Although these ships had been serviced at Honningsvåg, Norway, this was to be phased out and future LNG tanker shipments along the Northern Sea Route may occur between Murmansk and Kamchatka in Russia coastal waters.  On January 30, 2020, the United States Government lifted sanctions on Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) and its TC LNG.  There are some indications that Yamal LNG Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of its lenders. In February 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued Directive 3 Under Executive Order 14024, which prohibited U.S. persons from engaging in all transactions in, provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of greater than 14 days maturity and new equity issued by 13 Russian state-owned enterprises and entities, as well as their subsidiaries, on or after March 26, 2022. The entities included Transneft, Sberbank, AlfaBank, Credit Bank of Moscow, Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Rostelecom, RusHydro, Alrosa, Sovcomflot, and Russian Railways. Then, on March 5, 2022, the Russian Government issued Presidential Decree No. 95, which required that Russian borrowers make payments to foreign creditors from ‘unfriendly states’—including most countries that imposed sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine—in Russian rubles (irrespective of the currency of the loan), unless a permission to make direct payments in the contractual currency was granted by either the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) or Russia’s Ministry of Finance. This measure made it substantially more difficult for Russian borrowers to make timely payments on foreign- and local-currency debt to certain international creditors in their original currencies of denomination. In June 2022, the Russian Government defaulted on some of its dollar-denominated and euro-denominated debt.   The fact that at least two of OAO Yamal LNG's lenders (Sberbank and Gazprombank) faced international sanctions in 2022 and 2023 likely complicated loan repayment. Poten & Partners -- a firm that advises clients that are active in the international oil, gas and shipping markets -- noted in March 2022 that that 'latest round of sanctions has left Russian LNG sector companies and the domestic and foreign companies that provide finance and services to them struggling to assess their liabilities and exposure to counterparties. [...] Providers of the approximately [$20 billion] debt package for Yamal LNG included China Exim, CDB, Sberbank, Gazprombank, Russia’s National Wealth Fund (NWF), Russia’s ECA, Exiar, with smaller portions coming from Germany’s Euler Hermes, Sweden’s EKN, Austria’s Raiffeisen, JBIC and Intesa San Paolo. State development bank VEB also provided a US$3Bn guarantee to the project. Some of the Russian entities on the financing, including VEB, NWF and Exiar are now faced with sanctions. Novatek owns a 50.1% stake, with TotalEnergies and CNPC each holding 20% and China’s Silk Road Fund the remaining 9.9%. As the operating Yamal LNG project continues to service its loans, with a core group of lenders in Yamal LNG subject to sanctions, it will complicate arrangements. Parties who have contracts with the project such as shippers, suppliers and contractors are also potentially exposed to sanctions. It puts shareholders in a difficult position over whether to try and replace sanctioned entities. When Novatek and its partners were looking to raise funding for Yamal LNG, Russia’s annexation of Crimea forced them to makeover their financing plan. Financial advisor Societe Generale, and legal advisors White & Case and Latham & Watkins exited the project in 2014 and the financing was reworked to maximise support from Chinese and Russian lenders. It focused on using euros, Russian roubles and Chinese renminbi rather than US dollars to reduce sanctions risks. In its new form, the financing was successful, even though Novatek was subject to limited and defined US sanctions. But with the current round of restrictive measures, conditions are more challenging.'","Completion","Commercial","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Other Private Sector|Recipient Private Sector|Other Private Sector",939303179.446515,"This project involves the construction a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant located in Sabetta at the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula.

(“Nevsun”). Under the terms of the agreement, ENAMCO agreed to purchase a 30% ownership stake in the Bisha Mining Share Company (BMSC) from Nevsun Resources Ltd., which with the Government of Eritrea’s 10% free carried interest brought ENAMCO’s total ownership stake in BMSC to 40%. Then, in November 2007, China Eximbank issued an $80 million commercial loan to the Government of Eritrea for Phase 1 of Bisha Gold Mine Project.   The proceeds of this loan were use to partially fund ENAMCO’s acquisition of a 30% ownership interest in the Bisha Gold Mine. Then, on July 12, 2010, China Eximbank issued a $60 million follow-on loan to the Government of Eritrea for Phase 2 of the Bisha Gold Mine Project. The loan agreement for Phase 2 was signed by China Eximbank President Li Ruogu and the Eritrean Minister of Finance Berhane Abrehe It is unknown how the proceeds of this loan were used. The China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 is captured in Project ID#56386 and the China Eximbank loan for Phase 2 is captured in Project ID#73371. Construction of the mine began in September 2008 and was completed by 2010. The mine began the commercial production of gold in February 22, 2011, which allowed for an early payback of gold phase capital and allowed for complete funding of both the copper and zinc phase expansions. Then, the mine transitioned from gold production to copper production in late H2 2013 and commenced commercial production of copper in December 2013 and commercial production of zinc in October 2016 following the completion of the zinc expansion project. Then, on August 31, 2018, China Construction Bank Corporation (“CCBC”) issued a binding commitment letter in which it agreed to fully underwrite a $870,000,000 (approximately C$1.1 billion) loan to Gold Mountains (H.K.)

(20% ownership stake), and China's CNPC (20% ownership stake) and Silk Road Fund (9.9% ownership stake) — for the Yamal Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project. The financing from CDB and China Eximbank is part of the project finance package totaling the equivalent of $18.4 billion.  The total cost of the project is approximately $36 billion and it is being financed with a mix of debt and equity. The project reached financial close with CDB and China Eximbank in June 2016.   CDB issued both euro-denominated and RMB-denominated loans in support of this project. The euro-denominated loan tranche (captured in Project ID#67064) was worth EUR 5,057,800,000 and its interest rate was EURIBOR (-0.141%, April 2016) plus 330 basis points during the pre-completion stage and EURIBOR plus 355 basis points during the post-completion stage.

The RMB-denominated loan tranche (captured in Project ID#67041) was worth RMB 4,472,500,000 and its interest rate was EURIBOR plus 330 basis points during the pre-completion stage (-0.141%, April 2016) and EURIBOR plus 355 basis points during the post-completion stage. Its maturity length was 15 years.   In July 2016, OAO Yamal LNG withdrew a combined 450 million euros from the euro-dominated facilities of CDB and China Eximbank. The individual amounts withdrawn from each facility are unknown. The Yamal Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project is also being financed with a $3.069 billion loan (with a 15 year maturity) from Sberbank, a $1.023 billion loan (with a 15 year maturity) from Gazprombank, a Sinosure-insured EUR 730 million loan (with a 15 year maturity) from the Silk Road Fund (captured in Project ID#67040), an equity investment worth EUR 1.087 billion from the Silk Road Fund (captured in Project ID#67068), and an equity investment worth $5.513 billion by CNPC (captured in Project ID#67069).   The project involved the construction of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant — with 3 liquefaction trains and an annual production capacity of 16.5 million tons per annum based on the feedstock resources of the South-Tambeyskoye field — located in Sabetta at the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula. In addition to the LNG plant, the project included production at the Yuzhno-Tambeyskoye gas field, and the transport infrastructure, including the Sabetta seaport and airport. The Sabetta port is strategically located on the west bank of the Ob Bay, on the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug (YNAO). Its construction was designed to allow Novatek — Russia's second-largest (private) natural gas producer — to boost its exports to China and other Asian countries to compete with Russia’s number one gas producer Gazprom.   Technip France (France) and JGC Corporation (Japan), acting as one consortium, were the EPC contractors responsible for implementation. They are among the leading international engineering and construction companies with vast experience in front-end engineering design and execution of engineering, procurement and construction contracts for LNG plants worldwide. One of their subcontractors was China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). A groundbreaking ceremony for the Sabetta seaport was held on or around July 23, 2012; however, construction of the seaport did not begin until 2013. Despite the fact that the Russian government does not have an ownership stake in the borrowing institution (JSC Yamal LNG), when the project stalled in 2015 because of Western sanctions on Novatek, the Russian government quietly injected 150 billion rubles (approximately EUR 2.1 billion) into JSC Yamal LNG by tapping its rainy-day fund (the so-called “National Wealth Fund”). The Russian government never provided an explicit justification for the bailout, but Leonid Michelson and Gennady Timchenko are major shareholders of Novatek and personal friends of Vladimir Putin. As of April 2016, construction of the LNG plant was 65% complete. LNG production began on December 5, 2016. Then, on December 8, 2017, the commercial operation of the port and first LNG train (LNG purification facility) were launched by starting loading the first LNG carrier named after the late CEO of Total Christophe de Margerie. The loading was ceremonially launched by president Vladimir Putin in the presence of Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih. Then, in August 2018, the second production line (liquefaction train) of the LNG plant was launched. In November 2018, the third production line (liquefaction train) of the LNG plant was launched.   Yamal LNG has commissioned 15 LNG icebreaker/tanker ships to export its gas. Each icebreaker/tanker is designed to operate year-round from the Yamal peninsula and to break ice up to 2.5 meters thick. The ships are leased by Yamal LNG from four companies: Sovcomflot, one ship; MOL, three ships; Dynagas, five ships; and Teekay, six ships.  The tankers were designed in Finland by Aker Arctic Technology Inc. and built at the Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) shipyard in South Korea. The first icebreaker, Christophe de Margerie, traversed from Norway to South Korea across the Northern Sea Route in 19 days in August 2017.  When ice precludes shipping along the Northern Sea Route, then the Fluxys terminal at Zeebrugge, Belgium, will serve Russia as the LNG port for the Asia-Pacific region. Following the September 14, 2019 attack by Iran on Saudi Arabian oil fields at Khurais and Abqaiq (Biqayq in Arabic) during the 2019–2021 Persian Gulf crisis, the United States Government imposed sanctions under executive order 13846 against several companies including Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Seaman and Ship Management Company Ltd and the Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian (大連中遠海運油品運輸有限公司) which are two Cosco Shipping Company subsidiaries that are supporting LNG shipments from Sabetta. As of late September 2019, the Joint Venture TC LNG between the Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian company (50% stake) and the Canadian firm Teekay is the China LNG Shipping Ltd (CLNG) which has more than one third of Sabetta's LNG ice fleet, six ARC7 LNG tankers: Eduard Toll (Russian: «Эдуард Толль»), Rudolf Samoilovich (Russian: «Рудольф Самойлович»), Nikolay Evgenov (Russian: «Николай Евгенов»), Vladimir Voronin (Russian: «Владимир Воронин») all of which are operating, Georgy Ushakov (Russian: «Георгий Ушаков») which is going to Sabetta after sea trials, and Yakov Gakkel (Russian: «Яков Гаккель») which is under sea trials at a South Korean shipyard. Also affected were five ARC7 tankers which Dynagas will supply in a partnership between Sinotrans&CSC and CLNG (25.5% stake), as well as three ARC7 tankers from a joint venture between the Cosco subsidiary Shanghai LNG and Japan's MOL (株式会社商船三井). However, these former five and later three ARC7 tankers were not directly sanctioned but US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) rules require caution to be exercised in the former. Of the fifteen ARC7 tankers operating out of Sabetta, only Sovcomflot's Christophe de Margerie was not affected by the sanctions. Although these ships had been serviced at Honningsvåg, Norway, this was to be phased out and future LNG tanker shipments along the Northern Sea Route may occur between Murmansk and Kamchatka in Russia coastal waters.  On January 30, 2020, the United States Government lifted sanctions on Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) and its TC LNG.  There are some indications that Yamal LNG Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of its lenders. In February 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued Directive 3 Under Executive Order 14024, which prohibited U.S. persons from engaging in all transactions in, provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of greater than 14 days maturity and new equity issued by 13 Russian state-owned enterprises and entities, as well as their subsidiaries, on or after March 26, 2022. The entities included Transneft, Sberbank, AlfaBank, Credit Bank of Moscow, Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Rostelecom, RusHydro, Alrosa, Sovcomflot, and Russian Railways. Then, on March 5, 2022, the Russian Government issued Presidential Decree No. 95, which required that Russian borrowers make payments to foreign creditors from ‘unfriendly states’—including most countries that imposed sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine—in Russian rubles (irrespective of the currency of the loan), unless a permission to make direct payments in the contractual currency was granted by either the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) or Russia’s Ministry of Finance. This measure made it substantially more difficult for Russian borrowers to make timely payments on foreign- and local-currency debt to certain international creditors in their original currencies of denomination. In June 2022, the Russian Government defaulted on some of its dollar-denominated and euro-denominated debt.   The fact that at least two of OAO Yamal LNG's lenders (Sberbank and Gazprombank) faced international sanctions in 2022 and 2023 likely complicated loan repayment. Poten & Partners -- a firm that advises clients that are active in the international oil, gas and shipping markets -- noted in March 2022 that that 'latest round of sanctions has left Russian LNG sector companies and the domestic and foreign companies that provide finance and services to them struggling to assess their liabilities and exposure to counterparties. [...] Providers of the approximately [$20 billion] debt package for Yamal LNG included China Exim, CDB, Sberbank, Gazprombank, Russia’s National Wealth Fund (NWF), Russia’s ECA, Exiar, with smaller portions coming from Germany’s Euler Hermes, Sweden’s EKN, Austria’s Raiffeisen, JBIC and Intesa San Paolo. State development bank VEB also provided a US$3Bn guarantee to the project. Some of the Russian entities on the financing, including VEB, NWF and Exiar are now faced with sanctions. Novatek owns a 50.1% stake, with TotalEnergies and CNPC each holding 20% and China’s Silk Road Fund the remaining 9.9%. As the operating Yamal LNG project continues to service its loans, with a core group of lenders in Yamal LNG subject to sanctions, it will complicate arrangements. Parties who have contracts with the project such as shippers, suppliers and contractors are also potentially exposed to sanctions. It puts shareholders in a difficult position over whether to try and replace sanctioned entities. When Novatek and its partners were looking to raise funding for Yamal LNG, Russia’s annexation of Crimea forced them to makeover their financing plan. Financial advisor Societe Generale, and legal advisors White & Case and Latham & Watkins exited the project in 2014 and the financing was reworked to maximise support from Chinese and Russian lenders. It focused on using euros, Russian roubles and Chinese renminbi rather than US dollars to reduce sanctions risks. In its new form, the financing was successful, even though Novatek was subject to limited and defined US sanctions. But with the current round of restrictive measures, conditions are more challenging.'","Completion","Commercial","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Fund","Chinese State-owned Company|Other Private Sector|Recipient Private Sector|Other Private Sector",953336995.331323,"This project involves the construction a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant located in Sabetta at the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula.

The loan carries a 2.9% interest rate and a 14-year maturity. The Ministry of Finance of Bangladesh issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan on March 8, 2021.   The first loan disbursement took place on September 26, 2021. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance an EPC contract that it signed with a consortium consisting of Tianjin Electric Power Construction Co. Ltd., China Huadian Engineering Co. Ltd, and China Wanbao Engineering Corporation (TEPC-CHEC-CWEC) on March 6, 2019. The total cost of the project is approximately $2.54 billion and it is being financed according to a 70:30 debt-to-equity ratio.   The purpose of the project is to construct a thermal power plant with two 660MW coal-fired units (‘Unit 1’ and ‘Unit 2’) in Kalapara within Patuakhali District. The project site is located on the western bank of the Rabnabad River, in the vicinity of the Payra Port, 210km away from Dhaka and 160km away from Chittagong. Each 660MW power generation unit will be equipped with an ultra-supercritical boiler along with a high-efficiency steam turbine and a generator. The plant will be equipped with low nitrogen oxide (Nox) burner, electrostatic precipitators (ESP), and a flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) system to control emissions. Other components of the project will include a closed-cycle cooling system, 275m-high flue stacks, and a 400kV gas-insulated substation (GIS). The plant will source water from the Rabnabad River for cooling. The Patuakhali power plant is estimated to consume 4.48 million tonnes (Mt) of coal a year, which will be imported from Indonesia and Australia. Other infrastructure for the Patuakhali power project will include a coal jetty, coal handling and storage facilities, and access roads for transporting material and equipment. The project site will also house a water treatment facility and a warehouse building. The construction works are being facilitated by a concrete batching plant and a temporary project office. The electricity generated by the Patuakhali coal-fired power plant will be evacuated into the national grid of Bangladesh through a 400kV power transmission line. The power plant will process 12273 tons of coal per day and sell power to the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB).

The face value and borrowing terms are this loan are unknown.   The purpose of this $1.065 billion project was to construct a mine — with the capacity to produce 100,000 tons of cathode copper per year — in Salingyi Township, Monywa City, and Sagaing Province. The project produced more than 60,000 tons of cathode copper in 2017 and generated more than $14 million in revenue for the Government of Myanmar.   The Letpadaung Copper Mine Project is a large mine project operated by Myanmar Wanbao Mining Copper Limited (MWMCL), a subsidiary of Wanbao Mining Limited that was created in September 2011. Wanbao Mining Limited, a subsidiary of China North Industries Group Corp. (Norinco), a large arms manufacturer, bought the project from Ivanhoe, a Canadian mining company in 2011. It did so in cooperation with the Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd (UMEHL), which was granted a large scale production permit for the Letpadaung Copper Mine Project on March 5, 2010.  Ivanhoe had won the initial project from the Government of Myanmar pursuant to a series of agreements and feasibility studies from 1994 to 1996. A joint venture agreement was signed on April 10, 1996, but Ivanhoe divested its share of the project in 2011, citing the impact of the negative stigma of working with the military government on its other business throughout the world.   The project commenced under MWMCL ownership with Norinco International Cooperation Limited serving as the EPC contractor. Work began on November 20, 2011 and officially ended on March 11, 2016. On March 20, 2012, the foundation laying ceremony for the project was held.   Shortly after mine construction began in 2012, local villagers protested, raising concerns about environmental damage, land confiscation, involuntary resettlement, and various health risks associated with the mine. The authorities in Myanmar responded by brutally suppressing protesters, which in turn led to the creation of an investigative commission (led by Daw Aung San Suu Kyi) and the eventual renegotiation of a production sharing contract between MWMCL, the Government of Myanmar, and Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd (UMEHL) in 2013. The final, revised contract (signed on July 24, 2013) reduced the ownership stake of MWMCL from 45% to 30%, while the ownership stake of the Government of Myanmar increased from 4% to 51%.

KCP, which is jointly owned by KTO (50% equity stake) and CNODC (50% equity stake), was created to construct and operate the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline and the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline. These pipelines are two of three pipeline systems of the Kazakhstan-China Pipeline network, which was built to create a transport corridor for the export of Kazakhstani oil to China. ICBC financed the Atasu-Alashankou Section of Kazakhstan-China Oil Pipeline Project (as captured via Project ID#54527) and the Kenkiyak-Kumkol Section of the Kazakhstan-China Oil Pipeline Project (as captured via Project ID#54524).   However, KCP also signed a $896 million facility (loan) agreement with China Development Bank (CDB). The timing and purpose of the CDB loan agreement agreement is unknown.

Project ID#67108 captures ICBC’s $1.239 billion contribution  to the loan syndicate. Project ID#67109 captures China Eximbank’s $909 million contribution to the loan syndicate. Project ID#67110 captures Bank of China’s $619.8 million contribution to the loan syndicate. Project ID#67111 captures China Construction Bank’s $619.8 million contribution to the loan syndicate. The remaining contributions to the syndicated loan came from China Minsheng Bank ($371.88 million) and Ping An Bank ($371.88 million), both of which are privately-owned Chinese banks.    The loan carries a term (maturity) of up to 15 years and an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3.6% margin. As a credit enhancement, the borrower purchased a buyer’s credit insurance policy from China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure). The proceeds of this loan were to be used by the borrower to finance up to 85% of the cost of a $4,532,114,041.00 commercial (EPC) contract that it signed with CGGC-Niara — a joint venture of China Gezhouba Group Corporation (60% stake), Boreal Investments Limited (37.5% stake), and NIARA Holding (2.5% stake) — signed on June 11, 2015. As of December 31, 2021, the $4.1 billion syndicated loan had achieved a 100% disbursement rate.   The project involves the construction of 2171 MW Caculo Cabaça Hydroelectric Power Station, which is located at the village of São Pedro da Quilemba, near the city of Dondo, in Cuanza Norte Province. This location is approximately 195 kilometers (121 mi), by road, southeast of Luanda, the capital and largest city of Angola. The project has three main components: temporary river diversion works, main construction works, and the supply of electromechanical equipment. The main dam will be 103 meters (338 ft) in height, with crest width of 553 meters (1,814 ft), creating a reservoir lake that measures 16.3 kilometers (10 mi) in length, with a surface area of 16.6 square kilometers (6 sq mi).  Upon completion, the power plant is projected to generate an average of 8,566 gigawatt-hours of electricity a year, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 7.2 million tons annually.  An official inauguration ceremony marking the beginning of construction was held on August 4, 2017. Construction was originally expected to last 80 months, so project completion was scheduled for April 2024. However, the project subsequently encountered various delays and problems. In September 2017, a corruption investigation by Der Spiegel, the Portuguese newspaper Expresso, and European Investigative Collaborations, an independent journalism centre, revealed that the daughter of President José Eduardo dos Santos, billionaire businesswoman Isabel dos Santos, is the beneficial owner of Boreal Investments Limited (a shell company that was registered in Hong Kong in 2012). Then, on November 5, 2019, the President of Angola formally authorized Presidential Order No. 79/18 (from July 12, 2019) which amended the EPC contract for the 171 MW Caculo Cabaça Dam and Transmission Line Project by removing CGGC-Niara and Boreal Investments Limited so that ‘the only party to the contract is China Gezhouba Group Company Limited (CGGC)’. Then, in May 2022, there was a major labor disturbance at the project site. Protestors ransacked the management offices at the project site and the police shot three workers. The workers were reportedly angry over low wages and poor treatment by their employer (CGGC).  As of June 2020, 90% of tunneling work necessary to divert the Cuanza River to the dam had been completed and 3.47% of work on the dam itself had been completed. Then, on May 20, 2023, a ceremony was held to mark the temporary diversion of the Cuanza River, which marked the beginning of the main construction phase of the hydroelectric power project.  At that time, the project employed more than 2,500 workers, of whom more than 81 percent were local, and the connection of the first generator to the power grid was scheduled for completion by 2026.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Recipient Government Agency|Other Joint Venture/Special Purpose Vehicle|Chinese State-owned Company",1073398530.27818,"The project involves the construction of 2171 MW Caculo Cabaça Hydroelectric Power Station, which is located at the village of São Pedro da Quilemba, near the city of Dondo, in Cuanza Norte Province.

Two loans were issued to Tanzania’s Ministry of Finance: a $275 million buyer's credit loan (BCL) with an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 430 basis points, a 1.83-year (22 month) grace period, and a 12.83-year (154 month) maturity and a $920 million preferential’s buyer’s credit (PBC) with a 20-year maturity, a 7-year (84 month) grace period, and a 2% interest rate. The PBC (captured via Project ID#59752) was scheduled for semi-annual repayment every January 21 and July 21. It had a grace period of 84 months from the first loan disbursement date (June 20, 2013) and it was scheduled to be repaid in full 156 months from the end of the grace period. The BCL (captured via Project ID#59733) was scheduled for semi-annual repayment every January 21 and July 21. It had a grace period of 22 months from the first loan disbursement date (July 24, 2013) and it was scheduled to be repaid in full 132 months from the end of the grace period.  The PBC and BCL proceeds were on-lent from Tanzania’s Ministry of Finance to the Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC), which in turn used the proceeds to finance a September 2011 commercial (EPC) contract with China Petroleum Technology and Development Corporation (CPTDC), a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Company (CNPC).  The PBC and BCL were both secured with (i.e. collateralized against) all rights under a natural gas sales agreement between the Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO) and TPDC. The borrower (Tanzania’s Ministry of Finance) and end-user (TPDC) was required to deposit profits from the gas pipeline into three Stanbic Bank escrow accounts that were accessible to the lender. According to TPDC’s audited financial statements, the escrow accounts ‘were opened to secure repayment of principal and payment of interest and fees under the loan agreements’ and the minimum cash balances in these accounts functioned as sources of ‘collateral’. TPDC and Tanzania’s Ministry of Finance maintained a cash balance of TZS 42,011,517,702 in the escrow accounts as of June 30, 2014, TZS 120,509,276,347 as of June 30, 2015 (TZS 2,380,765,097 from TPDC and TZS 118,128,511,250 from Tanzania’s Ministry of Finance), $60,340,466 (TZS 131,473,427,000) as of June 30, 2016 ($1,473,574 from TPDC and $58,866,942 from Tanzania’s Ministry of Finance), $60,340,466 as of June 30, 2017, $60,320,710 (TZS 136,713,000,000) as of June 30, 2018, $60,320,710 (TZS 138,105,000,000) as of June 30, 2019 ($1,473,574 from TPDC and $58,866,942 from Tanzania’s Ministry of Finance), $60,320,710 (TZS 138,527,000,000) as of June 30, 2020 ($1,473,574 from TPDC and $58,866,942 from Tanzania’s Ministry of Finance), and $60,320,710 (TZS 138,673,000,000) as of June 30, 2021 ($1,473,574 from TPDC and $58,866,942 from Tanzania’s Ministry of Finance).

It withdrew these funds ‘as a penalty for [the Government of Tanzania’s] late repayment of due installment.’  The first PBC disbursement took place on June 20, 2013. The first BCL disbursement took place on July 24, 2013. Another loan disbursement (worth $126,495,423.10) took place in August 2014.

The gas pipeline project was designed and constructed to deliver natural gas to Dar es Salaam for use in power generation, industrial applications, household cooking and in propulsion of transport vehicles. It involved the construction of a 542 kilometer marine and terrestrial pipeline between Songo Songo and Dar Es Salaam as well as two processing plants: one in Songo Songo and another in Mnazi Bay.   The 542-kilometer gas pipeline has four parts: (i) 290-kilometer terrestrial pipeline of 36-inches diameter from Madimba in Mtwara to Somanga Fungu; (ii) 25-kilometer marine pipeline of 24-inches from Songo Songo Island to Somanga Fungu; (iii) 197-kilometer terrestrial pipeline of 36-inches diameter from Somanga Fungu to Kinyerezi in Dar es Salaam; and (iv) 30-kilometer terrestrial pipeline of 16-inches diameter from Kinyerezi to Tegeta in Dar es Salaam. It passes through 1 marine park, 4 regions, 8 districts, 41 wards and 113 villages. The capacity of the main (36 inch) pipeline is rated at 784 million standard cubic feet per day, according to the Natural Gas Utilization Master Plan 2016-2045, but can handle up to 1002 million standard cubic feet per day with compression. It is the longest gas pipeline that has ever been constructed in Tanzania.  CPTDC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction was officially launched on November 8, 2012 and the Tanzanian President inaugurated the constructed pipeline on October 10, 2015. The pipeline was originally scheduled for a completion date in 2014.   Loan repayment was originally expected to depend on gas sales upon completion of the pipeline construction and after the project's commercial operation date (COD). However, a review of the on-lending agreements, Gas Sales Agreements (GSA), and pipeline construction contract revealed that the pipeline was constructed before pre-identification and pre-signing of gas sales agreements between Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) and its expected major gas customers. This anomaly had an effect on loan repayment as actual gas sales came in far below the initial projection of 138.8 million standard cubic feet per day. In fact, according to a report published by the Government of Tanzania's Controller and Auditor General (CAG), TANESCO was the only gas consumer as of March 2017 -- with a consumption average of 46.61 million standard cubic feet per day instead of the agreed amount of at least 80 million standard cubic feet per day as per the GSA between TPDC and TANESCO.  There are also indications that the China Eximbank loans that were issued for the Songo Songo to Dar Es Salaam Gas Pipeline and Natural Gas Processing Plants at Mnazi Bay and Songo Songo Project have financially underperformed vis-a-vis its original objectives and the original expectations of the lender. Tanzania's National Audit Office (NAO) warned of 'Financial Distress Facing TPDC Due to Non-Settlement of TANESCO Long Outstanding Bills TZS 248 Billion' in its Annual General Report on the Audit of Public Authorities and other Bodies for the financial year 2016/2017. More specifically, the NAO noted that 'TPDC and TANESCO entered into a Gas Sales Agreement (GSA) in September 2015 whereby the TANESCO buys natural gas from TPDC for power generation at Kinyerezi, Ubungo II and Symbion Power Plants. I have noted that between September 2015 and December 2017 monthly invoices totaling to TZS 567,514,961,312.95. (USD 254,448,796.08), were issued by TPDC to TANESCO with respects to the natural gas supplied to TANESCO for power generation. My audit noted that by December 2017, TANESCO had managed to settle TZS 318,904,743,618.61 (USD 142,982,887.87) equivalent to 56% of the total amount of invoices leaving TZS 248,610,217,694.34 (USD 111,465,908.21) unsettled. TPDC may not be able to service the loan obtained to facilitate construction of Mtwara-Dar Gas Pipeline from EXIM Bank of China and their respective interests, if TANESCO does not settle this liability. Failure to repay the loan shall subject the Corporation to a compounded interest of 0.8% charged on the unpaid loan balance which will increase financial cost to TPDC and the Government. Further, failure to pay the loan shall amount to transfer of TPDC rights under the Gas Sales Agreement (GSA) to EXIM Bank of China as per Clause 2 of the Security Assignment Contractual Rights which forms of the Agreement signed between TPDC and EXIM Bank of China. The Government through Ministry of Finance and Planning and Ministry of Energy should consider assisting TANESCO in their efforts to settle such long outstanding dues which in turn will help TPDC meet gas purchase and other operational costs.' TPDC’s audited financial statements also indicate that, as the ultimate borrower/end user, it had fallen into arrears by 2017/2018. TPDC’s audited financial statements for the year ending on June 30, 2018 note that China Eximbank withdrew $19,806 from one of the escrow accounts between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2018 as a penalty for the borrower’s ‘late repayment of [a] due installment’. Then, in June 2019, TPDC announced that it was still having difficulty servicing its debts to the Government of Tanzania and it began to lobby for ‘debt relief’ — that is, for the Government of Tanzania to shoulder the responsibility of loan repayment instead of TPDC.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Other Private Sector|Recipient State-owned Company|Recipient State-owned Company",1080193673.29177,"This project supported the construction of a 542-kilometer marine and terrestrial gas pipeline that has 4 parts: (i) 290-kilometer terrestrial pipeline of 36-inches diameter from Madimba in Mtwara to Somanga Fungu; (ii) 25-kilometer marine pipeline of 24-inches from Songo Songo Island to Somanga Fungu; (iii) 197-kilometer terrestrial pipeline of 36-inches diameter from Somanga Fungu to Kinyerezi in Dar es Salaam; and (iv) 30-kilometer terrestrial pipeline of 16-inches diameter from Kinyerezi to Tegeta in Dar es Salaam.

The facility has a maturity of 15 years, and the Government of Angola is not required to make any repayments under the facility until the end of the disbursement period, which ends sixty months after the effective date of the facility (meaning the grace period is 5 years). The Government of Angola did not issue a sovereign guarantee for the loan, but China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) provided an export credit insurance policy for the facility and Eximbank provided 85% of the premium. The proceeds of the loan were used to finance up to 85% of the price of a commercial contract between Caioporto, S.A. and China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC).  Caioporto, S.A. is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) established and owned by the Government of Angola’s Sovereign Wealth Fund (Fundo Soberano de Angola) for the financing, construction and management of a deep-water commercial port in the village of Caio within Cabinda Province.  The only equity in this project was provided by a $180 million investment from Angola's Fundo Soberano de Angola (FSDEA) and an unknown investment amount by Quantum Global Group, an investment group founded by Swiss-Angolan Jean-Claude Bastos de Morais.  The Port of Caio Construction Project is being implemented in multiple phases.  The first phase involves the construction a 630 meter seaport wall, a 2 km bridge and access pier to the seaport terminal with 2km length, a 180 meter access channel, and a 200 meter-wide, 14 meter-deep docking basin.  The second phase involves the construction of a 200 meter-wide, 18 meter-deep access channel and a docking pier that is 1,130 meters long and 16 meters deep with the capacity to dock 4 large ships simultaneously and welcome some of the world’s largest ships.  Upon completion, the port will have the capacity to move about 60 containers per hour.  The project will cover an area of over 2,500 hectares, where customs facilities, workshops with port support and ship repair services, warehouses and commercial establishments will be built.  Phase 1 construction began in June 2017; however, as of March 2022, no funds had been disbursed through the China Eximbank facility agreement.  Then, on May 30, 2018, the contract for the project was halted by Presidential Order No. 66/18, effectively terminating the execution of the port project between Caioporto, S.A. and Angola’s Ministry of Transport. A year later, Presidential Order No. 166/19 halted the commission for the termination of the port project (in effect, undoing Presidential Order No. 66/18 and reactivating the project) and authorized the Angolan Minister of Transport to grant one of the port terminals of Porto do Caio to Caioporto, S.A. to guarantee the implementation of the project. Presidential Order No. 166/19 also made Caioporto, S.A. entirely owned by the Government of Angola’s Sovereign Wealth Fund (Fundo Soberano de Angola) after Jean-Claude Bastos de Morais (who was removed from his position at Fundo Soberano de Angola on suspicions of financial mismanagement) returned his assets to the Angolan Government.

The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the $1,289,029,000 China Eximbank loan tranche to finance 70% of the cost of a $1,841,470,000.00 commercial (EPC) contract between the Ethiopian Railway Corporation (ERC) and China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), which was signed on October 25, 2011 (and modified on November 5, 2012, February 7, 2013, and March 15, 2013) to support the construction of a 329 km Sebeta (Addis Ababa) to Miesso section of the railway. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the $981,260,000 China Eximbank loan to finance 70% of the cost of a $1,401,800,000 commercial (EPC) contract between the ERC and China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), which was signed on December 16, 2011 (and modified on modified on November 2, 2012, February 7, 2013 and March 8, 2013) to support the construction of a 339 km section of the railway that runs from Miesso (Meiso) to Dewelle (Dewanle) on Ethiopia's border with Djibouti. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the $220,471,000 China Eximbank loan to finance approximately 85% of a $259 million commercial contract between China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) and the ERC, which was signed in March 2013 to support the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project. The purpose of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 750.224 km railway from Sebeta to Nagad. The purpose of the Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 329.065 km railway section from Sebeta to Meiso (Mieso) that consists of two subsections: a 113.836 km railway subsection from Sebeta to Adama and a 215.229 km subsection from Adama to Meiso (Mieso). The purpose of the Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 339.182 km railway section from Meiso (Mieso) or to Dewelle (Dewanle/Dawanle) on Ethiopia's border with Djibouti. The line runs from Mieso to the east — via Mulu, Afdem, Bike,Gota, Erer, and Hurso — to Dire-Dawa. It then turns to the north before reaching Arawa, and then runs from Adigala to Lasarat, Aysha, Dawanle and the border between Ethiopia and Djibouti.  The purpose of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project was to acquire 5 electric locomotives, 6 diesel locomotives, 30 railway passenger cars and 1,100 railway freight cars for the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway.  * Loan Disbursements: According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $1,289,029,000 (ETB 24,004,264,432) loan tranche for the Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project achieved a 104% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 14 loan disbursements (worth ETB 24,905,259,256) between 2014 and 2020: an ETB 1,062,992,126 disbursement on July 8, 2014, an ETB 5,420,000,000 disbursement on October 8, 2014, an ETB 2,303,030,303 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 5,597,115,886 disbursement on April 8, 2015, an ETB 1,808,159 disbursement on October 7, 2015, an ETB 1,740,583,177 disbursement on January 7, 2016, an ETB 825,731,677 disbursement on April 7, 2016, an ETB 2,165,153,034 disbursement on July 7, 2016, an ETB 143,690,666 disbursement on October 7, 2016, an ETB 923,238,863 disbursement on January 7, 2017, an ETB 325,274,645 disbursement on April 7, 2017, an ETB 372,159,087 disbursement on July 7, 2017, an ETB  1,422,471,270 disbursement on September 20, 2017, and an ETB 2,602,010,364 disbursement on November 12, 2020.

The railway begins at Sebeta, just outside of Ethiopia's capital of Addis Ababa. The city is served by two stations in its southern outskirts, at Furi-Labu and Indode. The line then runs southeast to Modjo and Adama, both towns located in the Ethiopian Great Rift Valley. At Modjo, a railway junction exists for the planned Modjo–Hawassa Railway. In addition, at Modjo the railway is connected to the Modjo Dry Port, Ethiopia's most important inland dry port and also Ethiopia's main hub for domestic and international freight services. At Adama, the railway turns northeast towards Dire Dawa. At Awash, there is a junction with the Awash–Hara Gebeya Railway, which is under construction as of 2018. Directly after Awash station, the line crosses 60 meters above the Awash River canyon over a 155 meter long bridge, the main bridge of the railway.The railway then proceeds to Dire Dawa, where it turns and heads directly for Djibouti. Crossing the Ethiopia-Djibouti border between Dewale and Ali Sabieh, the line reaches the Djibouti passenger terminal at Nagad railway station, near Djibouti–Ambouli International Airport. In February 2001; the Government of Ethiopia asked CCECC to inspect the line and propose a construction plan. This plan was put on hold for several years due to a lack of funding. After years of continued deterioration due to mismanagement, a 2007 pre-feasibility study indicated that the line needed to be renovated (at a cost of approximately $3.4 billion. The proposed renovation of the railway was designed to include a double track from Addis Ababa to Adama, a single track from Adama to Dewele, a 1035 meter long bridge, the grand bridge at DK42, the 155 meter Awash grand bridge, and a Labu station upgrade. Upon completion, it was envisaged that the Yaji Railway would run passenger trains (at 120 km/hr) and cargo trains (at 80 km/hr).   * Project Implementation:  Construction began in 2012 and the project as a whole had achieved a 50% completion rate by 2014.  Track laying for the railway began in May 2015.  The railway was opened for passenger services on October 4, 2016. Then, on December 31, 2017, Ethiopian Railway Company issued a project handover certificate to CREC and CCECC. The next day, on January 1, 2018, a ceremony was held to mark the beginning of the railway’s commercial operations. Two days later, in January 3, 2018, a two-way passenger train on the Ethiopian section of the railway went into service.  The Yali Railway was the first overseas railway constructed by Chinese enterprises that adhered to international standards (1,435 mm gauge line and electrification at 25 kV) and used Chinese equipment (CSR Zhuzhou for the rolling stock). The Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was originally scheduled (under the terms of the EPC contract) to commence on February 12, 2012 and reach completion within 42 months (August 12, 2015). It was ultimately completed about 15 months behind schedule (November 12, 2016).  The Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was originally scheduled (under the terms of the EPC contract) to commence on April 12, 2012 and reach completion within 42 months (October 12, 2015). It was ultimately completed about 14 months behind schedule (December 12, 2016). The Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project was implemented between 2013 and 2015.  In April 2014, three diesel locomotives manufactured by arrived in Ethiopia by sea. Then, in October 2015, the ERC took delivery of 315 locomotives — that carry passengers and freight —  from NORINCO and Metals and Engineering Corporation. On December 13, 2015, 22 electric locomotives, 6 diesel locomotives and 6 passenger carriages arrived in the Port of Djibouti.   * Railway Operations & Management (Project Supervision and Control): On July 28, 2016, CREC and CCECC signed the Ethiopia-Djibouti Railway Operation and Management Agreement. The agreement specified that the CREC-CCECC consortium (also known as the CCECC-CREC JV and 中土集团与中铁二局亚吉铁路联营体公司) would manage the railway for 5 years (following construction completion). Then, on December 16, 2015, ERC and Société Djiboutienne de Chemin de Fer (SDCF) established a joint venture called the Ethio-Djibouti Standard Gauge Railway Company (EDR). ERC holds a 75% ownership stake and SDCF holds a 25% ownership stake in EDR. The main purpose of the EDR is to manage the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway (including the maintenance and renewal of all infrastructure and equipment) and to operate freight and passenger transport services on the line from 2024. The December 16, 2015 agreement specified that  CREC and CCECC would operate and maintain the railway for six years from the launch of operations and provide two additional years of technical support during the gradual handover of management duties to EDR from 2024.  * Financial Performance Problems: The project has faced financial problems associated with lower traffic volumes than predicted in the transport forecast and currency exchange rate fluctuations (as the project’s debt was issued in USD, but construction and operation costs as well as revenues are denominated in Ethiopian Birr or ETB).  It remains to be seen if the Yali Railway will find a path to commercial viability. The price of a railway passenger ticket was initially set at 30 Ethiopian birr (ETB). However, this price was subsequently deemed too high and reduced to 4 ETB, which means that the railway will generate substantially less ticket revenue than originally planned. Sinosure has reportedly written off $1 billion in losses due to the poor commercial performance of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway. In 2018, the Government of Ethiopia and China Eximbank agreed to restructure the project debt through a 20-year maturity extension and a 4-year grace period extension (see Project ID#61941).  The Government of Djibouti also requested a restructuring of its $491,793,000 buyer's credit loan agreement with China Eximbank for the 100 km Ali Sabieh to Nagad Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project on December 31, 2017.  The Djiboutian authorities reported to the IMF that a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed in 2019 to extend the grace period from 5 years to 10 years, extend maturity of the loan from 15 years to 25 years, and reduce the interest rate from 3.409% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 3% [300 basis points]) to 2.509% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 2.1% [210 basis points]). The Djiboutian authorities also indicated that arrears on interest payments on this loan that had been accumulated during the restructuring discussion (worth 1.2 percent of the country’s GDP) had been restructured—and that they were integrated to the principal and expected to be repaid over the extended amortization period The new terms of the loan reportedly reduced the present value of the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio by 4 percentage points and smoothed total debt service. However, the final loan restructuring agreement (captured via Project ID#85163) was not signed until September 2, 2020. It not only codified the terms and conditions that were first specified in the 2019 MOU, but also sought to improve the performance and profitability of the railway in order to increase revenue generation. The restructuring agreement was ratified into Djiboutian law in February 2021.    * Operational Performance Problems:  Energy supply is not always stable in Ethiopia, due to the variable level of water in the country’s dams. The lack of stable energy supply delayed the start of railway operations, even after construction was complete.  ‘Overvoltage’ problems also led to repeated service interruptions after the railway began commercial operations in early 2018. This is a technical problem where surges in the electrical grid (due to Ethiopia exporting power to its neighbors) lead to overvoltage in the railway transmission line, akin to blowing a fuse. The railway line has also been flooded on several occasions, halting or delaying services. The Ethiopian Government claims that the standards used by the Chinese companies to build the railway did not take flooding into account. CCECC and CREC, however, argue that their standards accounted for potential floods, but that, in the flooded sections, tracks were stolen, causing structural damage to the railroad. Field interview evidence has also revealed a number of accidents involving animals (camels in particular) being hit by trains and killed. As the ERC has paid more than the market price for camels in compensation, there are suspicions that people are pushing their camels in front of trains deliberately. There is a plan is to build a fence along the railway, which should reduce accidents and enable trains to travel faster, from the current 50 km/h to 80 km/h. However, there is a risk that this may in turn create other problems, including interrupting paths used by people and animals. Railway service interruptions have also occurred due to protests, For example, in late July 2021, a group of Somali Region protestors blocked the railway line following an attack by Afar regional militia. The line reopened on August 3, 2021.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Government Agency",1106897147.20179,"The purpose of the Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 339.182 km railway section from Meiso (Mieso) or to Dewelle (Dewanle/Dawanle) on Ethiopia's border with Djibouti.

The PBC (loan) carries the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a 7 year grace period, and a 2.5% interest rate. The loan’s final maturity date is September 21, 2033. As of December 31, 2020, Nigeria’s Debt Management Office (DMO) reported that the China Eximbank loan had achieved a 57.14% disbursement rate ($562.47 million) and the borrower had made interest repayments worth $26.36 million and no principal repayments to the lender. As such, the loan’s (principal) amount outstanding, as of December 31, 2020, was $562.47 million. The borrower is expected to use the proceeds of the loan to finance approximately 75% of a $1.293 billion commercial contract between the Government of Nigeria and a consortium consisting of Sinohydro and China National Electric Engineering Co (CNEEC), which was signed on October 19, 2012. The Government of Nigeria agreed to directly finance the remaining 25% of the commercial contract cost.   The purpose of the project is to construct a 700WM hydroelectric power plant — with four, 175MW power generators — on the Kaduna River in Niger State (exact locational coordinates: 9.90091, 6.28723). The project also involves the construction of a dam, electricity transmission lines, and associated substations to evacuate power from the dam. Upon completion, the power plant is expected to generate 2.64 billion kWh of electricity a year. The project is also expected to support flood control, irrigation, as well as water supply and fish breeding facilities. According to a ‘valuation report’ that was undertaken prior to implementation, the project would likely negatively impact 22,100 persons, 15,958 farmlands and 6,762 properties domiciled in 98 communities. Sinohydro and CNEEC are the contractors responsible for project implementation.   On May 28, 2013, a groundbreaking ceremony was held. Then, on January 22, 2018, the placement of the first silo of Roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) took place. As of June 18, 2020, the Government of Nigeria’s Debt Management Office (DMO) reported that China Eximbank had disbursed 52.65% of the original face value of the PBC. By October 28, 2019, the project had achieved a 68% completion rate. The rotor of the first power generation unit was hoisted into place on September 30, 2021. Then, on March 28, 2022, the first (175MW) power generation unit went into operation. The unit was officially commissioned on April 1, 2022. However, the broader project has encountered major implementation obstacles and delays.   In 2015, the project stalled due to insufficient compensation of communities affected by the power plant (requiring resettlement) and litigation by aggrieved persons.  Nigeria’s then Minister of State for Power, Mohammed Wakil, confirmed the stoppage of the project in an interview. He said: ‘immediately [after] the Zungeru project took off, we had legal challenges. Somehow in the communities, some people, I can say powerful people instituted court action and in fact they succeeded in getting an injunction restraining government from further doing the project. […] At a point we had about two to three litigations on the project but the ministry has been trying to resolve the problems outside the court. A committee has been set up and they have held several meetings with the parties involved. It is a national project and we do not want to be unnecessarily bogged down by litigations. […] We are being careful and are engaging the parties with a view to settling out of court. That has tampered with our timetable but even with that there has been a lot of progress.’ Nigeria’s Director of Power, Sanusi Garba, said at the time that ‘you cannot pay 98 communities overnight. We have checks and counter checks at every point in time, and it is a slow and laborious process because you don’t want to pay someone twice and you don’t want to omit anybody.’   Then, in January 2022, three Chinese workers were abducted from the project site after a shoot-out that killed workers and police.  In March 2022, Nigeria’s Minister of Power, Abubakar D. Aliyu, said ‘[i]t’s unfortunate that the insecurity in some parts of the country has affected the delivery of the Zungeru Hydro Plant project because some persons were abducted by bandits and have not been released’.   The 700MW Zungeru Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project was originally scheduled for completion by the end of 2017. However, its scheduled completion date was later pushed back to December 2021 and then December 2022.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Recipient State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company",1110348939.05149,"Zungeru Dam is located on the Kaduna River in Niger State.

63475,"China (People's Republic of)","Zimbabwe","Africa",2015,NA,"China Eximbank provides $997.7 million preferential buyer’s credit for 600 MW Hwange Makomo Power Station Expansion Project","On December 1, 2015, the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank) and Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance signed a $997.7 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement for the 600 MW Hwange Makomo Power Station Expansion Project. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 7-year grace period, a 2% interest rate, a 0.25% management fee, and a 0.25% commitment fee. It disbursed $200 million in June 2018, $129.6 million in 2020, $33.83 million in 2021, and $171.6 million in 2022.   The loan’s amount outstanding (including principal, interest, and arrears) was $217,121,910.95 as of 2021.    Zimbabwe’s Ministry of Finance used the loan proceeds to on-lend to Hwange Electricity Supply Company (HESCO), which is a special purpose vehicle (project company) that is jointly owned by Zimbabwe Power Company (64% equity stake) and Sinohydro (36% equity stake). HESCO entered into a power purchase agreement (PPA) with Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC) to off-take electricity from the constructed Hwange 7 & 8 Thermal Power Station. HESCO is expected to service the China Eximbank PBC with revenue derived from power sales to ZETDC.    The total cost of the 600 MW Hwange Makomo Power Station Expansion Project is $2.148 billion and it is being implemented on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30. Standard Bank (unknown amount) and AfreximBank ($176 million) are the other sources of debt financing. 85% of the cost of HESCO’s engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract with Sinohydro will be covered by the China Eximbank PBC. The remaining 15% ($176 million) will be provided through an equity contribution from Sinohydro. The purpose of the project is to construct Unit 7 and Unit 8 at the Hwange Makomo Power Station, and thereby increase the power generation capacity of the Hwange Makomo Power Station from 600 MW to 1200 MW (through the addition of two power generation units). Hwange Makomo Power Station is a coal-fired power plant and the 14th largest thermal station in the Southern African region. It is adjacent to the Wankie Colliery Open Cast Mine.   The station was built in two stages. The first four power generation (4x120 MW) units were commissioned between 1983 and 1986 and the fifth and sixth power generation (2x220 MW) units were commissioned in 1986 and 1987. These six units are already functional and the station currently generates about 40% percent of the country’s electricity needs. Coal is delivered to the station by an overland conveyor belt which is 6 kilometers long from Hwange Colliery Company Limited (HCCL) as well as by trucks from Makomo and Coalbrick mines. Water that is piped 44 kilometers from the Zambezi River is pumped into two 150,000-cubic-meter reservoirs next to the station and conveyed by gravity to its point of use. Sinohydro is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation and it has hired 2532 employees (620 Chinese workers and 1912 local workers) as well as 252 sub-contractor employees (including 217 local workers). After the PBC agreement with China Eximbank was signed on December 1, 2015, the lender demanded that the Government of Zimbabwe meet several conditions, including parliamentary ratification of the PBC; the establishment of a debt service reserve agreement (DSRA) between the Government of Zimbabwe, China Eximbank and HESCO; the establishment of a PPA between HESCO and Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC); the establishment of an agreement between Government of Zimbabwe and HESCO outlining the incentives for the project (in terms of taxation) and guaranteeing ZETDC’s payments to HESCO; the signing of a coal supply agreement between HESCO and Makomo Resources, and the signing of a limestone supply agreement between HESCO and PPC (Zimbabwe). These requirements led to project implementation delays.    The first loan disbursement from China Eximbank took place in June 2018, which paved the way for project commencement on August 1, 2018. The project was originally expected to reach completion within 42 months (February 1, 2022). A formal groundbreaking ceremony was organized on June 27, 2018. Then, on March 1, 2019, a foundation stone laying ceremony took place. As of November 2019, the project had achieved a 25% completion rate. Then, in September 2020, reports emerged that the borrower had failed to comply with the terms of its escrow account agreement with China Eximbank and it instead issued a savings bond as collateral (security) in favor of the lender. By February 2021, the project was running behind schedule; it had achieved a 58.29% completion rate (against a target completion rate of 78.5%). The delay was attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic and unpaid invoices (IPC payments). As of April 2022, Forbes Chanakira, a project manager for the Hwange Makomo Power Station Expansion, reported that the project had achieved an 84.2% completion (progress) rate. He reported that the turbines and generator sets for Unit 7 had been constructed and were awaiting commissioning. At that time, the boiler was about 93% complete and the coal stockyard was expected to be operational in May 2022. The boiler’s control system, the Distributed Control System (DCS), had also been activated. Hot commissioning, a process in which coal is used in the boiler to heat steam, was expected at the time to begin by July 2022. It was expected to last until November 2022 when the unit would be handed off.    Forbes Chanakira also stated in April 2022 that about 810 of the 875 transmission towers built between Hwange and Bulawayo had been placed. At the time, on the 368 km section between Hwange and Bulawayo, a new 400KV line — that would run parallel to the current lines — still needed to be built. The route had been separated into three sections: Bulawayo to Lupane, Lupane to Gwayi, and Gwayi to Hwange, where engineers were working on building towers alongside other construction work.

67325,"China (People's Republic of)","Turkey","Europe",2019,NA,"ICBC contributes to $4.435 billion syndicated debt financing package for Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge (Kurtköy-Akyazı Section) Refinancing Project (Linked to Project ID#67331)","On May 29, 2012, Turkey's Ministry of Transport granted a 10-year concession agreement to ICA IC İçtaş Astaldi Üçüncü Boğaz Köprüsü ve Kuzey Marmara Otoyolu Yatırım ve İşletme A.Ş. (IC Ictas-Astaldi or ICA) — a joint venture between an Italian construction company called Astaldi S.P.A (33.33% ownership stake) and a Turkish construction company called IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S. (66.66% ownership stake) — for the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project (also known as the Third Bosphorus Bridge PPP Project and the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge PPP Project). 30 months of the 10-year concession is for bridge construction activities and the remaining period is for bridge management activities. The public-private partnership (PPP) project was implemented on a BOT (Build, Operate, Transfer) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20. The original, non-recourse $2.67 billion debt financing package consisted of two syndicated loan agreements with two different special purpose vehicles (project companies): a $1.04 billion loan with Avrupa Otoyolu Yatirim ve Iletme A.S. for the 171 km Kurtköy-Akyazı Section (“Asia Section” or “NMM Asia”) of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project and a $1.63 billion loan with KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. for the 90 km Kınalı-Odayeri Section (“Europe Section” or “NMM Europe”) of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project. The loan agreements were signed in September 2013 and financial close was achieved May 2014. The loan were issued by six local banks, including Turkish banks (Türkiye Garanti Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Is Bankasi A.S., QNB Finansbank A.S., T.C. Ziraat Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. and Türkiye Vakiflar Bankasi T.A.O.). One loan will mature in December 2022 (with a fixed interest rate of 7.6%) and the other will mature in June 2024 (with a floating interest rate of LIBOR + 550 basis points).   Additionally, $600 million of equity financing was provided by Astaldi S.P.A and IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S.: $387.33 million IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S. and $193.67 million from Astaldi S.P.A. The Government of Turkey issued a sovereign guarantee, agreeing to repay the debt incurred by borrower/project company (IC Ictas-Astaldi) in the event that it defaulted on its repayment obligations. The Government of Turkey’s General Directorate of Highways (KGM) also provided a minimum traffic guarantee to the project company (to secure the payback of the debt and equity if the generated revenue was insufficient).   Then, in 2018, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's branch in Turkey (ICBC Turkey) was mandated by IC Ictas-Astaldi to lead and arrange syndication for the refinancing of $2.67 billion of debt used to construct the Third Bosphorus Bridge (or Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge) and North Marmara Motorway PPP Project. A letter of authorization for the refinancing was signed at the One Belt, One Road Investment and Financial Cooperation Summit in Ankara on July 26, 2018. Under the agreement, ICBC Turkey agreed in principle to facilitate the refinancing of the project, previously funded by the Turkish banking system, on more favorable terms.   Then, in September 2019, two syndicated loan agreements worth $4.435 billion were signed (with ICBC serving as the lead arranger) for the Kurtköy-Akyazı and Kınalı-Odayeri sections of the project: a $2,840,000,000 loan agreement was signed by KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. and a group of ten lenders (ICBC Turkey, Bank of China, Kuveyt Türk Katilim Bankasi A.S., Albaraka Türk Katılım Bankası A.Ş., Türkiye Garanti Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Is Bankasi A.S., QNB Finansbank A.S., T.C. Ziraat Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. and Türkiye Vakiflar Bankasi T.A.O.) to refinance the $1.04 billion loan that was issued in September 2013 for the 171 km Kurtköy-Akyazı Section of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project and finance new/additional capex requirements as a result of changes in the project scope (that increased the total cost of the project’s 171 km Kurtköy-Akyazı Section to $3.646 billion); and a $1,595,000,000 loan was signed by KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. and a group of ten lenders (ICBC Turkey, Bank of China, Kuveyt Türk Katilim Bankasi A.S., Albaraka Türk Katılım Bankası A.Ş., Türkiye Garanti Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Is Bankasi A.S., QNB Finansbank A.S., T.C. Ziraat Bankasi A.S., Türkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. and Türkiye Vakiflar Bankasi T.A.O.) to refinance the $1.63 billion loan that was issued in September 2013 for the 90 km Kınalı-Odayeri Section of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project and finance new/additional capex requirements as a result of changes in the project scope (that increased the total cost of the project’s 90 km Kınalı-Odayeri Section to $2.077 billion). The two loans have two different maturity lengths, reflecting the different concession lengths of the two sponsors. The Government of Turkey issued a sovereign guarantee for both loans on September 16, 2019. The total amount that was reportedly provided (across both loans) by ICBC Turkey was $1 billion (as captured via Project ID#67325). Bank of China’s estimated contribution to both loans ($381,666,666) is captured via Project ID#67331.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 1.408 kilometer long-span bridge to be used by road vehicles and trains to cross the Bosphorus Strait from Poyrazkoy in Asia to Garipce in Europe, as well as the construction of a section of the North Marmara Highway along the Odayeri-Pasakoy route. The bridge is 59 meters long and it stretches 1,408 meters over the Bosporus, linking the European and Asian sides of Istanbul. It has eight highway lanes (4 in each direction), divided by two high-speed rail corridors of 1,048 meters. The bridge is a critical part of the larger Northern Marmara Highway (Motorway) Project, linking to the Odayeri-Pasaköy route of the Motorway. The 261 km km Northern Marmara Highway was intended to increase economic efficiency in Turkey, allow for greater access to Istanbul Airport, provide alternate routes to going through Istanbul, and start on the western side of Istanbul and end in the eastern Marmara province of Sakarya. ICA IC İçtaş Astaldi Üçüncü Boğaz Köprüsü ve Kuzey Marmara Otoyolu Yatırım ve İşletme A.Ş. (IC Ictas-Astaldi) was responsible for project implementation. Construction began in September 2012 using the SPV's equity, and was originally expected to take 36 months. The Odayeri-Paşaköy section of the motorway was completed August 26, 2016. The Kurtköy-Akyazı section of the project was completed and opened to traffic on December 19, 2020.   On December 23, 2019, China Merchants Expressway Network & Technology Holdings Co. Ltd, China Merchants Union (BVI) Limited, Jiangsu Expressway Company Limited, Zhejiang Expressway Co. Ltd., Anhui Expressway Company Limited and Sichuan Expressway Co announced that it had entered an agreement and jointly set up a consortium company (“Consortium Company”) to acquire: (1) 51% equity stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi (the SPV responsible for the Third Bosphorus Bridge PPP Project); (2) 51% of a related shareholder loan of IC Ictas-Astaldi; and (3) 51% equity stake in Eurasia Motorway Maintenance and Operations Limited (“IC Maintenance”), a company engages in the operations and maintenance of projects operated by IC Ictas-Astaldi. Shareholders of the Consortium Company expected to invest up to $688.5 million. As a part of the acquisition, China Merchants, China Merchants United, Zhejiang Expressway, Jiangsu Expressway, Sichuan Expressway and Anhui Expressway held 31%, 20%, 17.5%, 17.5%, 7% and 7% equity stakes in the Consortium Company, respectively. Upon completion of the acquisition, the Zhejiang Expressway Co., Ltd. would indirectly hold an 8.925% equity stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi, 8.925% of the related shareholder loan of IC Ictas-Astaldi, and an 8.925% equity stake in IC Maintenance, respectively. However, the preliminary agreement that was signed on December 23, 2019 was interrupted due to the Covid-19 pandemic. ICBC, Bank of China, and China Merchants Bank subsequently indicated that they were willing to issue a $1.6 billion loan to the Consortium Company in 2021 to facilitate their acquisition of a 51% ownership stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi for $688.5 million. Their loan would mature in 2027, just before the project company’s concession expired. Sinosure would provide credit insurance. However, IJ Global reported in August 2021 that the Chinese companies in the Consortium Company requested to enter into negotiations to terminate the acquisition agreement. Then, in March 2020, Astaldi sold its stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi (the SPV) to IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S., with the latter becoming the sole owner.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Commercial Bank","Other Joint Venture/Special Purpose Vehicle",1123564612.26213,"The purpose of the project was to construct a 1.408 kilometer long-span bridge to be used by road vehicles and trains to cross the Bosporus Strait from Poyrazkoy in Asia to Garipce in Europe, as well as the construction of a section of the North Marmara Highway along the Odayeri-Pasakoy route.

The borrower was required to keep a minimum deposit balance of 15-20% of total outstanding loans in an escrow account. All subsidiary loans approved through this framework agreement were to carry the following terms: a 5-year grace period, a 20-year maturity and a 0.25% interest rate.    According to the Congolese authorities, only one subsidiary loan was ultimately approved through this framework agreement: a $1 billion loan in 2012 for the Dolisie-Brazzavile Section of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project (captured in Project ID#369). The loan’s (principal) amount outstanding was $1,000,000,000 as of December 31, 2019.  This project, which is also known as Phase 2 of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project, involved the construction of a 376 km road segment along National Route 1 (NR1) between Dolisie and PK45 north of Brazzaville.    China Eximbank also issued multiple loans for Phase 1 of the Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) Construction Project (captured in Project ID#68874, ID#72780, ID#72781, and ID#72782). China State Construction Engineering Corporation Ltd. (CSCEC) was the contractor responsible for the implementation of Phase 1 and Phase 2.    The groundbreaking ceremony for Phase 2 took place on December 22, 2011. Phase 2 was completed on October 3, 2015. The four-lane, 535 km Pointe-Noire-Brazzaville Road (RN1) was officially inaugurated on March 1, 2016.    The $1 billion China Eximbank loan that supported Phase 2 was rescheduled on April 29, 2019. Under the terms of the debt rescheduling agreement, the Republic of Congo agreed to repay 33% of its its outstanding obligations for the Phase 2 (375 km Dolisie-Brazzaville Section) of National Route 1 (RN1) Construction Project within 3 years (more specifically, by December 31, 2021). For the remaining 67% of its outstanding obligations, the Republic of Congo agreed to a new repayment schedule that involved extending the maturity the loan by 15 years (from 20 years to 35 years) and resetting the interest rate of the loan from 0.25% to to 2%.  This debt rescheduling is captured in Project ID#58340.    Around the time of the rescheduling, the Republic of Congo was facing a balance of payment crisis and it decided to concession the RN1 through a toll-operate-transfer (TOT) privatization. The concession was won by La Congolaise des Routes S.A. (LCR), a joint venture between CSCEC (70% ownership stake), Egis Projects (15% ownership stake) and the Congolese Government (15% ownership stake). As of March 2019, LCR operated the RN1 through a 30-year franchise agreement. According to Li Jiqin, Chairman of CSCEC International, CSCEC reached out to the Republic of Congo for this deal because the NR1 was left unmaintained after its construction was completed in 2016.  Under this new agreement, CSCEC is responsible for maintaining the road while the French company, Egis, is responsible for managing toll collection.

The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. Sinosure provided export buyer’s credit insurance for this syndicated BCL.  The total cost of the Independent Power Project (IPP) was $1.5 billion and it was financed with a mix of debt and equity. The borrower used the syndicated BCL proceeds to finance 85% a $1,177,527,060 EPC contract signed in August 2011 with a consortium of companies including: China Chengda Engineering Co. Ltd, Dongfang Electric Corporation (DEC), the Southwest Electric Power Design Institute (SWEPDI), and Zhejiang Electric Power Construction (ZEPC).

It carried the following terms: a 17-year maturity, 5-year grace period, a 0.2% interest rate, and a 0.25% default (penalty) interest rate. The borrower was originally expected to make 24 semi-annual repayments between 2011 and 2022. The proceeds of the supplier’s credit were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of its $648,832,000 commercial contract with CMEC. The Republic of Congo agreed to cover the remaining 15% of the commercial contract cost ($97,325,000) itself.   Over the lifetime of the supplier’s credit, the Republic of Congo agreed to repay $557,849,330.50 in principal and interest. Then, on January 18, 2006, the supplier’s credit agreement was modified (in particular, Articles 6, 8 and 13). The project execution period was reduced from 5 years to 3.5 years and additional changes were introduced related to the name of the lender; the credit conditions; loan repayment and amortization table; the duration, validity and termination of the credit; and the conditions of entry into force of the credit.   Then, on April 13, 2018, CMEC and the Republic of Congo signed another supplier’s credit agreement modification to reschedule the repayment terms. The parties agreed that the outstanding balance of the loan ($348,614,050) would be repaid according to the following repayment terms: 22-year maturity, a 0.2% interest rate, and 14 semi-annual installments between June 2021 and December 2027. As such, the rescheduling agreement effectively increased the grace period of the supplier’s credit by an additional 3 years (from June 2018 to June 2021).

(66.66% ownership stake) — for the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project (also known as the Third Bosphorus Bridge PPP Project and the Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge PPP Project). 30 months of the 10-year concession is for bridge construction activities and the remaining period is for bridge management activities. The public-private partnership (PPP) project was implemented on a BOT (Build, Operate, Transfer) basis and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20. The original, non-recourse $2.67 billion debt financing package consisted of two syndicated loan agreements with two different special purpose vehicles (project companies): a $1.04 billion loan with Avrupa Otoyolu Yatirim ve Iletme A.S. for the 171 km Kurtköy-Akyazı Section (“Asia Section” or “NMM Asia”) of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project and a $1.63 billion loan with KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. for the 90 km Kınalı-Odayeri Section (“Europe Section” or “NMM Europe”) of the Northern Marmara Motorway and Third Bosphorus Bridge Project. The loan agreements were signed in September 2013 and financial close was achieved May 2014.

The Government of Turkey issued a sovereign guarantee, agreeing to repay the debt incurred by borrower/project company (IC Ictas-Astaldi) in the event that it defaulted on its repayment obligations. The Government of Turkey’s General Directorate of Highways (KGM) also provided a minimum traffic guarantee to the project company (to secure the payback of the debt and equity if the generated revenue was insufficient).   Then, in 2018, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's branch in Turkey (ICBC Turkey) was mandated by IC Ictas-Astaldi to lead and arrange syndication for the refinancing of $2.67 billion of debt used to construct the Third Bosphorus Bridge (or Yavuz Sultan Selim Bridge) and North Marmara Motorway PPP Project. A letter of authorization for the refinancing was signed at the One Belt, One Road Investment and Financial Cooperation Summit in Ankara on July 26, 2018.

Bank of China’s estimated contribution to both loans ($381,666,666) is captured via Project ID#67331.   Then, on December 2, 2021, ICBC and KMO Anadolu Otoyol Isletmesi A.S. signed a $1,198,302,550 loan agreement (captured via Project ID#96108) to refinance a $2,138,000,000 loan that was issued on May 13, 2014 signed in 2014 and a $420,000,000 loan that was issued on March 11, 2016 for the Odayeri-Paşaköy Section of the Northern Marmara Motorway (including Third Bosphorus Bridge) Project. The borrowing terms of the ICBC loan are unknown.  The Government of Turkey issued a sovereign guarantee for the $1,198,302,550 loan on December 2, 2021.  The purpose of the project was to construct a 1.408 kilometer long-span bridge to be used by road vehicles and trains to cross the Bosphorus Strait from Poyrazkoy in Asia to Garipce in Europe, as well as the construction of a section of the North Marmara Highway along the Odayeri-Pasakoy route. The bridge is 59 meters long and it stretches 1,408 meters over the Bosporus, linking the European and Asian sides of Istanbul. It has eight highway lanes (4 in each direction), divided by two high-speed rail corridors of 1,048 meters. The bridge is a critical part of the larger Northern Marmara Highway (Motorway) Project, linking to the Odayeri-Pasaköy route of the Motorway. The 261 km km Northern Marmara Highway was intended to increase economic efficiency in Turkey, allow for greater access to Istanbul Airport, provide alternate routes to going through Istanbul, and start on the western side of Istanbul and end in the eastern Marmara province of Sakarya. ICA IC İçtaş Astaldi Üçüncü Boğaz Köprüsü ve Kuzey Marmara Otoyolu Yatırım ve İşletme A.Ş. (IC Ictas-Astaldi) was responsible for project implementation. Construction began in September 2012 using the SPV's equity, and was originally expected to take 36 months. The Odayeri-Paşaköy section of the motorway was completed August 26, 2016. The Kurtköy-Akyazı section of the project was completed and opened to traffic on December 19, 2020.   On December 23, 2019, China Merchants Expressway Network & Technology Holdings Co. Ltd, China Merchants Union (BVI) Limited, Jiangsu Expressway Company Limited, Zhejiang Expressway Co. Ltd., Anhui Expressway Company Limited and Sichuan Expressway Co announced that it had entered an agreement and jointly set up a consortium company (“Consortium Company”) to acquire: (1) 51% equity stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi (the SPV responsible for the Third Bosphorus Bridge PPP Project); (2) 51% of a related shareholder loan of IC Ictas-Astaldi; and (3) 51% equity stake in Eurasia Motorway Maintenance and Operations Limited (“IC Maintenance”), a company engages in the operations and maintenance of projects operated by IC Ictas-Astaldi. Shareholders of the Consortium Company expected to invest up to $688.5 million. As a part of the acquisition, China Merchants, China Merchants United, Zhejiang Expressway, Jiangsu Expressway, Sichuan Expressway and Anhui Expressway held 31%, 20%, 17.5%, 17.5%, 7% and 7% equity stakes in the Consortium Company, respectively. Upon completion of the acquisition, the Zhejiang Expressway Co., Ltd. would indirectly hold an 8.925% equity stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi, 8.925% of the related shareholder loan of IC Ictas-Astaldi, and an 8.925% equity stake in IC Maintenance, respectively. However, the preliminary agreement that was signed on December 23, 2019 was interrupted due to the Covid-19 pandemic. ICBC, Bank of China, and China Merchants Bank subsequently indicated that they were willing to issue a $1.6 billion loan to the Consortium Company in 2021 to facilitate their acquisition of a 51% ownership stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi for $688.5 million. Their loan would mature in 2027, just before the project company’s concession expired. Sinosure would provide credit insurance. However, IJ Global reported in August 2021 that the Chinese companies in the Consortium Company requested to enter into negotiations to terminate the acquisition agreement. Then, in March 2020, Astaldi sold its stake in IC Ictas-Astaldi (the SPV) to IC İçtaş Construction Industry ve Ticaret A.S., with the latter becoming the sole owner.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Commercial Bank","Recipient Joint Venture/Special Purpose Vehicle",1198302550,"The purpose of the project was to construct a 1.408 kilometer long-span bridge to be used by road vehicles and trains to cross the Bosporus Strait from Poyrazkoy in Asia to Garipce in Europe, as well as the construction of a section of the North Marmara Highway along the Odayeri-Pasakoy route.

According to the terms of the agreement, CREC and Sinohydro would be granted a 68 percent stake in a new joint venture (JV) named the Sino–Congolais des Mines (Sicomines SARL), and a Congolese parastatal called Générale des Carrières et des Mine SARL (Gécamines SARL) would own the other 32 percent. In exchange, the CREC and Sinohydro would provide the Government of the DRC with turnkey public infrastructure projects (worth $6.56 billion) financed by China Eximbank. The terms of lending were not identified in the “protocol d’accord”.  Then, on April 22, 2008, a “convention de collaboration” (Chinese name: 关于刚果民主共和国矿业开发和基础设施建设的合作协议) was signed by the Government of the DRC and Sinohydro (on behalf of Sicomines). It specified that two tranches of infrastructure financing—reportedly worth $3 billion each—would be disbursed and that subsidiary loans approved under the first tranche and second tranche would carry the following terms: a 25-year maturity and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 100 basis points (or 3.839% at the time of the agreement). The proceeds from these loans would be disbursed to the Chinese contractors responsible for individual infrastructure projects.  The April 2008 agreement specified that ownership of the Sicomines joint venture was allocated such that CREC holds 43% ownership of the joint venture, Sinohydro holds 25%, Gécamines holds 20%, and a Mr. Gilbert Kalam Babanika (who was eventually appointed as deputy head of Sicomines) holds 12%. On June 28, 2008, an amendment to the agreement was signed, which change the ownership allocation to CREC: 28%, Sinohydro: 20%, China Metallurgical Group Corporation: 20%, Gécamines: 20%, Mr. Gilbert Kalam Babanika: 12%. On September 11, 2008, a second amendment was signed, which further changed the ownership allocation to CREC: 33%, Sinohydro: 30%, Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt: 5%, Gécamines: 20%, Mr. Gilbert Kalam Babanika: 12%.  Project ID#450 provides a list of the infrastructure projects and subsidiary loans that have been approved to date. Additionally, as part of the April 22, 2008 “convention de collaboration,” it was reported that the Chinese company consortium were to provide 2.9 billion USD in loans to cover 1) 32 million USD loan to Gécamines to cover its initial capital injection to Sicomines (the total registered capital of Sicomines in 2008 was 100 million USD); 2) 50 million USD loan to Gécamines to procure supplies; and 3) to provide a shareholder loan for the development of the copper and cobalt mine at Kolwezi.  The $2.9 billion was financed by a $870.1 million, interest-free shareholder loan (prêt d’actionnaire) from China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), Sinohydro Corporation and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt, and a $2.0299 billion loan from China Eximbank at a fixed interest rate of 6.1%. Project ID#73204 captures the interest-free shareholder loan from China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), Sinohydro Corporation and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt. Project ID#73145 captures the loan from China Eximbank. At the end of Fiscal Year 2013, Sino–Congolais des Mines (Sicomines SARL) disclosed that it had received loan disbursements worth $423,889,454. However, it did not disclose if these disbursements came from the China Eximbank loan, the interest-free shareholder loan (prêt d’actionnaire) from China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC) and Sinohydro Corporation, or both loans. CREC likely provided 422 million USD in interest-free loans, Sinohydro provided 383.7 million USD in interest-free loans, and Zhejiang Youhua provided 64.4 million USD in interest-free loans.   The Congolese government agreed to provide a sovereign guarantee for both the infrastructure loan and the mining loan from China Eximbank. Another unique feature of the April 22, 2008 agreement was the inclusion of a $350 million signing bonus from the consortium of Chinese firms. However, following pressure from the IMF and civil society, an amendment (Avenant No. 3 à la Convention de Collaboration Relative au Developpement d’un Projet Minier et d’un Projet d’Infrastructures en République Démocratique du Congo du 22 Avril 2008) was made to the “convention de collaboration” in October 2009. It reduced size of the infrastructure loan from $6 billion to $3 billion and removed the sovereign guarantee for the copper and cobalt mining loan from China Eximbank.  The sovereign guarantee for the infrastructure loan was left in place. China Eximbank was not a party to this amended agreement, which specified that if the floating (market) interest rate on the infrastructure loan (LIBOR plus 100 basis points) rose higher than the rate (4.4%) referenced in the April 22, 2008 “convention de collaboration”, an expanded consortium of Chinese firms (CREC, Sinohydro, and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Company Ltd) would assume responsibility for the additional interest payments. The profits from the investment by SICOMINES SARL in the copper and cobalt mine at Kolwezi would be used to repay the loans that finance the costs of developing the copper and cobalt mine and the unrelated infrastructure projects. However, nearly four years after the October 2009 amendment was signed, the Congolese parliament had still not ratified it and China Eximbank became concerned about the risk of non-repayment. In order to limit its risk exposure, China Eximbank suggested that it take over Gécamines’ 32 percent ownership stake and that the Chinese consortium’s 68 percent ownership stake be mortgaged until the infrastructure and mining loans were repaid. The Congolese government rejected these proposed changes, and China Eximbank responded by rescinding its funding in early 2012. Then, the Chinese firms began negotiating with two alternative financiers: China Development Bank and the Bank of China. In July 2013, China Eximbank reversed its decision to halt funding for development of a copper and cobalt mine in Kolwezi. Construction of the mine began in April 2013, and on November 6, 2015 the first phase of the mining project was completed. The second phase commenced on May 21, 2020. As of July 2021, the second phase of the project had successfully produced its first batch of cathode copper.

The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 20-year maturity, a 3.5-year grace period, and an annual interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 1.6% margin. The borrower was expected to repay the loan between December 2012 to June 2029. It was also expected to use the loan proceeds to finance 85% of the cost of a $970 million commercial (EPC) contract with China National Electric Equipment Corporation (CNEEC), which was signed in November 2008.   Sinosure and World Bank insured the buyer's credit loan (export credit facility) and the Government of Botswana’s Ministry of Finance also provided a sovereign guarantee. As an additional credit enhancement, the borrower agreed to maintain a minimum cash balance of $33 million (equivalent to one principal and interest repayment/installment) in a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA). The Government of Republic of Botswana funded the DSRA with P300 million while Botswana Power Corporation paid the balance of P48 million.   The total cost of the Morupule B Power Project was $1.6623 billion. It was financed according to a 70:30 debt-to-equity ratio. ICBC contributed $825 million of debt financing, while the World Bank, and the African Development Bank contributed $136.4 million and $202.5 million of debt financing, respectively. The 30% equity contribution ($498.4 million) came from Botswana Power Corporation and the Government of Botswana.   In addition to the long-term (20-year) export credit facility, ICBC provided a short-term $140 million equity bridge loan to the project sponsor (BPC) to ensure that it could meet its equity contribution requirement. The borrowing terms that applied to the equity bridge loan are unknown. However, it is known that the loan was guaranteed by Standard Bank.  Standard Bank also provided 20-year currency and interest rate hedging for the export credit facility – a cross-currency swap designed to convert US dollar funding into fixed rate synthetic Botswana Pula, thus minimizing BPC's exposure to adverse movements in foreign exchange and interest rates, and enabling the sponsor to align loan currency with the currency of its revenue stream for the full repayment period.  The project involved the construction of a 600MW coal-fired power plant consisting of 4x150MW units — that uses circulating fluidized bed technology — for domestic power generation purpose. The 600MW Morupule B power plant is located in the township of Palapye, northeast of Gaborone, and it geographically adjacent to the existing 132MW Morupule A power plant. It sources feedstock from the same mine as the existing 132MW Morupule A plant. The project has three main components: the Morupule B Power Station; a 400kV Morupule B–Phokoje transmission system and associated sub-stations linking the plant to the BPC grid; and a 35-borehole well-field and associated water reticulation system. The coal is sourced from the Morupule coal mine, which is the only major operating coal mine in Botswana.  The Morupule coal mine is operated by Morupule Colliery Limited, a subsidiary of Debswana Diamond Company.   China National Electric Equipment Corporation (CNEEC) was the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Shenyang Blower Works (Group) Co., Ltd (SBW) also supported the project as a subcontractor.  Site and contractor’s camp accommodation facilities as well as bush clearing activities started in early June 2009 and were effectively completed by the end of July 2009, which facilitated CNEEC-SBW to undertake Topographical Survey and Geotechnical Investigation to confirm the design parameters associated with the in-situ ground geological data at the site area. The erection of the contractor’s camp facilities started in November 2009. The camp had the capacity to accommodate approximately 1,500 staff. The project's official EPC contract commencement date was April 29, 2009. However, the project's groundbreaking ceremony did not take place until February 19, 2010. It was originally envisaged that the power plant plant would become operational by October 2012. However, the project experienced significant delays and CNEEC did not hand over the four power generation units to the BPC until May 4, 2014. Then, in October 2014, three of the four power generation units broke down, and the Government of Botswana had needed to consider importing energy from South Africa. The power plant was originally expected to operate at the annual capacity factor of about 80 percent, with annual gross generation of about 4,200 gigawatt-hour (GWh). However, the plant’s capacity factor was closer to 50 percent, reflecting poor availability and unreliability of the units due to forced outages. Units 1-4 had the capacity to produce 600MW, but they only operated at 21 percent capacity producing only 130MW. According to BPC's 2019 Annual Report, BPC signed a Defects Remediation Agreement with CNEEC to remedy the plant's defects, which was expected to result in the remediation of all plant defects in a phased manner between 2019 and January 2023.   Efforts were also undertaken to expand the plant’s power generation capacity to 900MW after a tender for construction of two additional units (Unit 5 and 6) was awarded to a joint venture between Japanese Marubeni and South Korea’s Posco Energy.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Commercial Bank","Recipient State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese Private Sector",1239231226.53344,"The Morupule B Power Station is located near the town of Palapye within the Central Province.

95996,"China (People's Republic of)","Iraq","Middle East",2020,NA,"Government of Iraq secures oil-backed loan for 1260MW Salah Al-Din Oil-fired Thermal Power Plant Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#95982)","On May 11, 2018, China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) and the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Iraq signed an export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement (contract ID# FA-IRAQ-001). Under the terms of the 20-year agreement, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Iraq is authorized to borrow up to $10 billion (or an equivalent amount in other currencies such as RMB) via subsidiary buyer’s credit facility agreements with PRC banks and/or commercial contracts with deferred payment clauses (i.e. supplier’s credits) with Chinese companies (exporters) for projects in the ‘oil, gas, energy, infrastructure, communications, education, healthcare or electricity sectors’ that are ‘located in the areas in Iraq deemed safe by the Embassy of China and the Government of Iraq.’ All borrowings under the framework agreement, which is captured via Project ID#95982, must carry maturity lengths that do not exceed 15 years and they must be backed by an approved credit insurance policy from Sinosure. The framework agreement also specifies that the Government of Iraq is responsible for making advance payments worth no less than 15% of the total cost of the underlying commercial contracts supported by the subsidiary buyer’s credits and supplier’s credits.   To repay and secure these borrowings, the framework agreement specifies that a Crude Oil Sales Agreement between Iraq's state-owned oil marketing company (SOMO or شركة تسويق النفط) and an unspecified Chinese oil importer, wherein SOMO agrees to sell no fewer than 100,000 barrels of crude oil per day to the Chinese oil importer and the Chinese oil importer agrees to make payments to SOMO due under the Crude Oil Sales Agreement by depositing U.S. dollars (or another foreign currency) in a Sinosure-designated and lender-controlled bank (escrow) account (that is opened on behalf of the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Iraq to facilitate debt repayment).  Under the terms of the framework agreement, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Iraq is required to maintain a minimum cash balance of $100 million in a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) and pledge the DSRA in favor of Sinosure. Apart from the DSRA, the framework agreement refers to two additional escrow accounts: an Oil Settlement Account and a Repayment Account. All oil sale proceeds first flow to the Oil Settlement Account. Then, after deductions are made by the United Nations Compensation Commission for compensation due to Kuwait, the remaining revenue flows to the Repayment Account (so long as there is still a $100 million minimum cash balance in the DSRA) and principal and interest payments to lenders are made from the Repayment Account.   On September 23, 2019, account agreement and oil agreement annexes to the framework agreement were finalized. Then, on September 23, 2019, the framework agreement officially went into effect. Approximately 15 months later, in December 2020, a Financial Advisor to Iraq’s Prime Minister, Dr. Mudhar Muhammad Salih, told the Iraqi News Agency (INA), that Iraq’s House of Representatives would need to identify the specific projects to be funded under the framework agreement and allocate funds for these projects in the Federal Budget Law. He also signaled at the time that the Iraqi Government planned to borrow through the export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure to fund the construction of school buildings. Then, in June 2021, he announced that the 2021 Federal Budget Law included $2 billion for projects to be financed through the export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure, which had entered into force. 5 months later, in November 2021, he told a local newspaper that several Chinese companies had deposited $1.8 billion in an account and the funds would be used to support the construction of 1,000 schools as well as ‘infrastructure and renewable power projects’. This announcement implies that the Government of Iraq ultimately decided to borrowed via commercial contracts with deferred payment clauses (i.e. supplier’s credits) with Chinese companies rather than buyer’s credit facilities with PRC banks. On June 30, 2022, Dr. Mudhar Muhammad Salih said that ‘[t]he operations of depositing money and withdrawing from the [escrow] account are continuing for the benefit of the projects concluded within the [export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure].’ He also noted that ‘the [escrow] account is managed very carefully by the Central Bank of Iraq, and the financial operations are audited by the major international financial auditing companies.’  There are three known projects — supported by four separate commercial contracts — that are being financed under the export credit insurance cooperation framework agreement with Sinosure: the 1260MW Salah Al-Din Oil-fired Thermal Power Plant Construction Project, the Construction of 1000 Schools Project, and the Al-Nasiriyah International Airport Renovation and Expansion Project. In September 2013, China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) and Ministry of Electricity of Iraq signed a $1,189,132,251 commercial (EPC) contract for the 1260MW Salah Al-Din Oil-fired Thermal Power Plant Construction Project. This contract was amended on November 21, 2019 and its monetary value was increase by $140 million (to ~$1,329,132,251) after CMEC and the Government of Iraq signed a financing memorandum on September 22, 2019. The estimated monetary value of the supplier’s credit for the 1260MW Salah Al-Din Oil-fired Thermal Power Plant Construction Project is $1,129,762,413.35 (as captured via Project ID#95996).   The purpose of the project is to construct an oil-fired thermal power plant that consists of two subcritical, oil-fired generating units of 630MW capacity each (‘Unit 1’ and ‘Unit 2’). Upon completion, each unit is expected consist of a boiler drum along with a boiler furnace equipped with oil and gas nozzles, and a single shaft steam turbine. The boiler assembly will feature four-corner tangential combustion chamber, along with single-hearth balanced ventilation supported by steel structure frame. The design boiler maximum continuous rating (BMCR) will be 2136t/h. Each double back pressure, impulse type steam turbine will feature three cylinders and four exhausts. The other major components of the plant will include three-stage high pressure heaters, four- stage low pressure heaters, eight-stage regenerative deaerators, apart from steam-driven feedwater pumps. The project also includes four 20,000m3 oil mixing tanks, air compressors, as well as the construction of 400kV and 132kV booster stations. The electricity generated by the power project will be evacuated through a 400kV power transmission line connecting the national grid of Iraq. The power plant is located approximately 16 km southeast of the Samara city in Salah Al-din Province on the north bank of the Tigris River (and approximately 186 km north of Baghdad).   CMEC is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, Northwest Research Institute of Energy China, SGS, the Fourth Construction of China Machinery Industry Co., Ltd., China Valves Technology, Inc. and Sichuan Railway Investment Group Co., Ltd. are also involved in implementation as subcontractors.  Project implementation officially commenced on August 14, 2012. However, civil construction works did not begin until April 2013. The project was originally expected to reach completion within 45 months (January 2017). Construction works were suspended in June 2014 due to the fact that Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) launched a major attack in northern Iraq against the Iraqi government, which led to a major deterioration in the local security situation. Construction works resumed in mid-2018. As of August 2019, 1200 Chinese and Iraqi workers were assigned to the project. Then, on November 21, 2019, the Ministry of Electricity of Iraq (MOELC) and China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) signed an expanded and amended EPC contract, which allocated $140 million of additional funding for additional repair and inspection work and the construction of a new 132kV substation. On April 1, 2020, Zhang Tao, the Chinese Ambassador to Iraq, and a team from the Red Cross Society of China visited the power plant and provided on-site Covid-19 pandemic prevention and control guidance. Fifteen days later. On April 16, 2020, the boiler hydraulic test for Unit 1 took place, marking an important milestone of the project. Unit 1 began trial operations on June 2, 2021. However in late-June 2021, ISIS launched a set of targeted by Katyusha rockets at the Salah Al-Din Oil-fired Thermal Power Plant and severely damaged parts of Unit 1.  The Unit 1 boiler was ignited on May 11 , 2022, and it was connected to the grid on May 12, 2022. Unit 1 then began a 720-hour reliability test on May 20, 2022. On June 19, 2022, Unit 1 passed the 720-hour reliability test. CMEC then handed over Unit 1 to the project owner in July 2022, which marked halfway point of the implementation of the project. On August 27, 2022, Unit 2 was connected to the national grid for the first time and officially put into operation.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Company","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Other Private Sector|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company",1261760467.13576,"Government of Iraq secures oil-backed loan for 1260MW Salah Al-Din Oil-fired Thermal Power Plant Construction Project.

The PBC agreement also specifies that the remaining 15% of the cost of the project must be funded by the borrower. The Government of Guinea met this counterpart funding requirement by selling its 51% equity stake in Société De Gestion de Kaléta (SOGEKA) — the project company responsible for the 240MW Kaléta Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project (see Project ID#53003) — to China Three Gorges Corporation for $200 million.  Then, on September 4, 2018, the Government of Guinea and China Eximbank signed the PBC agreement. The Government of Guinea, in turn, used the proceeds from the PBC to on-lend to a special purpose vehicle (SPV) called Société de Gestion et d'Exploitation du Barrage de Souapiti, SA (SOGES S.A. or 苏阿皮蒂电站管理公司). SOGES S.A., which was established as a project company in August 2017, is jointly owned by the Government of Guinea (51% equity stake) and China International Water & Electric Corporation (49% equity stake). SOGES S.A signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the state-owned power utility, Electricité de Guinée (EDG), and once the Souapiti dam is operational, it will use the proceeds from the sale of electricity (generated by the dam) to EDG (for 20 years) in order to facilitate the repayment of the China Eximbank loan. Under the terms of the PPA, the Government of Guinea guaranteed the payment obligations of EDG to SOGES S.A. The Government of Guinea also issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the China Eximbank loan (PBC).   The loan’s first tranche of $575 million was disbursed at the end of 2020. The loan’s second tranche of $300 million was originally expected to disburse in 2021 and the loan’s third tranche of $300 million was originally expected to disburse in 2022. However, neither of these disbursements took place. The second tranche was rescheduled for disbursement in 2023 and the third tranche was rescheduled for disbursement in 2024.  As of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2021, Guinea’s Ministry of Economy and Finance identified the outstanding repayment obligations of SOGES S.A. under the China Eximbank PBC agreement as $575.11 million.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 450MW hydroelectric power plant (hydropower station) — with four power generation units — in the middle reaches of the Konkoure River (approximately 6 km downstream of China Eximbank-financed 240MW Kaleta hydropower station). Upon completion, the plant was expected to achieve an average annual output of 2.016 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) and serve both domestic customers and several neighboring countries in West Africa (including Senegal, Mali, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea-Bissau through the West African power grid). The Souapiti hydropower station consists of a roller compacted concrete (RCC) gravity dam and a ground powerhouse equipped with four vertical-axis Francis turbine generators of 112.5 MW rated capacity each. Each turbine is designed to operate at a rated head of 87 meters. The RCC gravity dam is 120 meter-high and has a crest elevation of approximately 215.5 meters, while the dam axis length is approximately 1,164 meters. The normal storage capacity of the dam is approximately 6.3 billion cubic meters (bcm) and the design water storage level is 210 meters. The other mechanical component in the project includes 21 flat steel gates, 12 trash racks, two arc gates, six hydraulic hoists, two fixed hoists, one sewage gate crane, and a tailgate crane station. A double trolley 160/50 tonnes (t) bridge crane was utilized for the lifting and installation operations during the project construction. The electricity generated by the Souapiti hydropower station is fed into the grid through an 8.7 km, 225kV double-circuit power transmission line connecting the Kaleta (Kaileta) substation.   China International Water & Electric Corporation, a subsidiary of China Three Gorges Corporation (CTGC), was the general (EPC) contractor responsible for implementation.  However, many subcontractors were also involved. Harbin Electric Machinery Company manufactured and supplied the turbines and other hydroelectric units for the project. Sinohydro Bureau 3rd was subcontracted by CTCG for the civil engineering, grouting, electromechanical, and metal structures works in 2016, while Sailors Automation Technology Company was subcontracted for the supply of automation components in September 2018. Tractebel Engie was engaged to provide supervisory services for the project. It also assisted in the environmental and social impact assessment (ESIA) as well as the resettlement action plan (RAP). Yellow River Engineering Consulting was subtracted by CWE for the design and engineering services of the project. Yingtai Group delivered nine 10kV voltage grade 1,600KW diesel generator sets for the project. Nodalis updated the feasibility study and evaluated the technical and economic viability of the hydropower project.   On December 24, 2015, a groundbreaking ceremony took place. However, main civil construction works did not commence until April 2016. The first and second power generation units achieved grid connection on November 8, 2020 and November 30, 2020, respectively. The third power generation unit achieved grid connection on January 5, 2021. The fourth power generation unit achieved grid connection on March 25, 2021. The power plant reached its commercial operation date (COD) on June 24, 2021. A final project completion certificate was issued in July 2022.   However, according to a Human Rights Watch (HRW) report published in April 2020, the Souapiti Hydroelectric Power Plant Construction Project has been plagued by a variety of social, environmental, and governance problems:  ‘[t]he dam’s reservoir will ultimately displace an estimated 16,000 people from 101 villages and hamlets. The Guinean government had moved 51 villages by the end of 2019 and said it planned to conduct the remaining resettlements within a year. Forced off their ancestral homes and farmlands, and with much of their land already, or soon to be flooded, displaced communities are struggling to feed their families, restore their livelihoods, and live with dignity. […] Residents displaced by the dam are resettled in concrete houses on land ceded by other villages. Residents have so far not obtained legal titles to their new land, creating a risk of future land conflicts between displaced families and host communities. Displacement is rupturing longstanding social and cultural links between families in the area. “In our culture, our social and familial bonds are essential,” said one displaced resident. “Extended families are being split apart. Whenever there is something to celebrate or mourn in the family, we feel the distance.”   Souapiti’s reservoir is also flooding a vast area of agricultural land, threatening communities’ means of subsistence. The dam’s reservoir will eventually flood 253 square kilometers of land, including an estimated 42 square kilometers of crops and more than 550,000 crop-bearing trees. A 2017 project document warned starkly that, “displaced populations will generally have less favorable land than they have been farming for generations.” Dozens of displaced residents told Human Rights Watch that they are already struggling to find adequate food for their families. “The people here are hungry, sometimes I don’t eat so my children can,” said a woman displaced from the village of Tahiré Center in 2019. Residents from several villages said that, whereas before being displaced they used to grow their own food, they must now find enough money to buy it from local markets. “With the fields gone, we’re slowly selling our cattle to make ends meet,” said a local herder and farmer. “We’re fragile like eggs because of the suffering here,” said a community leader relocated in 2019. “It’s only thanks to God that we survive.” Officials [from SOGES S.A.] acknowledged that displacement threatens communities’ livelihoods. “When you move a village, you’re breaking up the way they make a living, and you have to try to reestablish it,” said the [SOGES S.A.] head of environmental management and sustainable development. [SOGES S.A.] said it intends to restore communities to the same or improved standard of living that they enjoyed prior to the resettlement. SOGES S.A.] does not provide displaced residents with replacement farmland but said it will assist them to farm more intensively on their remaining land and find new income sources, such as fishing or cattle-raising. Displaced residents, however, have so far received no such assistance. “We’re not asking for something extraordinary. Prepare land for us to continue our activities, a pasture area for livestock farming. Respect the promises made,” said the president of Tahiré District, which encompasses several villages relocated in June 2019. International human rights standards require that resettled populations have immediate access to livelihood sources, and that resettlement sites should include access to employment options. The 2015 and 2017 action plans prepared to guide the resettlement recommended that [SOGES S.A.] begin work on livelihood restoration programs as soon as construction on the dam started in 2015.   At the end of 2019, however, [SOGES S.A.] had not started implementing livelihood restoration measures and displaced populations were receiving no support to help them reestablish the farming-dependent lifestyle they had left behind. [SOGES S.A.]told Human Rights Watch that it is, “in the process of redoubling its efforts to invest in the restoration of livelihoods in the coming month and for years to come.” [SOGES S.A.] pointed out that, in the short term, the government has provided food assistance – two deliveries of rice over six months and cash for basic essentials – to displaced families. “It helps people get on their feet,” said a [SOGES S.A.] official. But residents said that, given how long it would take to find new livelihoods, this was not enough. “We consumed what we were given in just over a month,” said a father of five who resettled in June 2019 from Warakhalandi. International standards recommend that displaced communities receive support until they return to the living standards they enjoyed prior to resettlement. [SOGES S.A.] also said that it compensates residents for the trees and crops growing on flooded land, although it has provided no payments to reflect the value of the land itself. Farmers have therefore received no compensation for land lying fallow as part of a crop rotation system, nor for land used for grazing animals.   A lack of transparency in the compensation process – with [SOGES S.A.] failing to adequately inform people about how compensation is calculated – has also fueled dissatisfaction with the payments made. Some residents said they have not been paid any compensation at all; others contend that, while they had been compensated for perennial crops, like fruit trees, they have received nothing for annual crops like rice or cassava. “The government gave us what they wanted. We accepted money without negotiation because we didn’t know the value of our resources,” said one village leader. Several women said that the bulk of compensation has been paid to men in family or community leadership roles, giving women little say over how money is used. Residents from all the villages Human Rights Watch visited said that they had complained to representatives of [SOGES S.A.] or to local government officials about the resettlement process, but that they had received either no response or one that did not address their concerns. “Someone says give [your complaint] to this person. They ask you to wait. He also has his director. Who are we supposed complain to?” said a community leader from Konkouré district. [SOGES S.A.] told Human Rights Watch that it had “delayed” in implementing a formal grievance policy, and only did so in September 2019, after more than fifty villages had been moved. [SOGES S.A.] did not explain the reason for the delay. As of December 2019, 110 complaints had been submitted to the new grievance mechanism. [SOGES S.A.] said that for future relocations is it negotiating agreements with communities that set out the Agency’s responsibilities during the process. While this could help clarify displaced residents’ rights, a sample agreement shared by [SOGES S.A.] contains only a single paragraph summary of the Agency’s obligations and offers no detail on how [SOGES S.A.] will address key issues like lack of agricultural land and support for livelihood assistance. [SOGES S.A.] should also ensure that residents have access to independent legal advice, of their choice, prior to signing agreements.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese Private Sector|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Other Private Sector|Chinese State-owned Company|Other Private Sector|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese Private Sector",1281084266.33427,"The purpose of the project is to construct a 450MW hydroelectric power plant (hydropower station) — with four power generation units — in the middle reaches of the Konkouré River (approximately 6 km downstream of the China Eximbank-financed 240MW Kaléta hydropower station).

China Eximbank permitted DBK to draw down up to $5 billion from a master facility agreement (MFA), which included an unrestricted $1.5 billion tranche and a restricted $3.5 billion tranche. The agreement was for a period of up to 15 years and it prohibited DBK from incurring indebtedness exceeding 25% of its assets or disposing of over 25% of its assets, in addition to a change of control clause favoring China Eximbank. The restricted portion of the MFA was for projects with a Chinese component, whereas the unrestricted portion was for DBK’s general purposes.   The restricted portion of the China Eximbank MFA was aimed at the development of energy, transport and communication infrastructure and the funding of strategic projects in the metallurgy, chemical, and oil industries. The proceeds from this credit facility were also be used for investment projects of Kazakhstani companies, including the exporting of industrial output, services and equipment to China. Under the restricted portion of the China Eximbank MFA (as captured via Project ID#54797), DBK entered into a $884 million individual credit agreement with China Eximbank on December 12, 2009. The maturity date of this individual credit agreement was July 21, 2023. Principal and interest under the agreement was to be paid semi-annually. The loan was prepaid in full in July 2019.  DBK then used these loan proceeds to on-lend to Atyrau Refinery LLP (a project company and special purpose vehicle responsible for the financing, design, and construction of the Aromatic Hydrocarbons Complex Construction Project at the Atyrau Refinery) as part of a larger $1.63 billion loan agreement. This loan agreement with Atyrau Refinery LLP, which is a subsidiary of KazMunayGas (a state-owned oil and gas company in Kazakhstan), was divided into a $691.4 million tranche with an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 4.5% margin, a $40.4 million tranche with an interest rate of 7.72% per annum (payable in KZT), and a ₸58.536 million KZT tranche with an interest rate of 10.99% per annum (payable in KZT).

Then, Nam Ngum 3 Power Company Limited entered into a tariff MOU with the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) on the 480MW Nam Ngum 3 Hydropower Project. Then, in 2013/2014, Électricité du Laos (EDL) — the state corporation of Laos that owns and operates the country's electricity generation, electricity transmission and electricity distribution assets — acquired full ownership of the NG3 from Nam Ngum 3 Power Company Limited.   On July 28, 2014, in Beijing, China Eximbank and EDL signed a buyer’s credit financing framework agreement for the NG3 Project. According to the framework agreement, China Eximbank agreed to provide a $1.2 billion buyer’s credit loan (BCL) to EDL to facilitate its acquisition of equipment from Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. and support its implementation of the NG3 Project. Official sources confirm that a $1.2 billion BCL agreement (transliterated “commercial loan” from China) from China Eximbank was subsequently issued to EDL. However, the precise signing date of the agreement is unknown. The borrowing terms of the BCL are unknown. The proceeds of the BCL were to be used by the borrower to partially finance a $1.29 billion commercial (EPC) contract with Sinohydro Corporation Ltd.   The purpose of the NG3 project was to construct a 210 meter-high concrete face rockfill dam (CFRD) with a total capacity of 480 MW (3x160 MW) on the Ngum River in Xaysomboune Province, about 130 km north of Vientiane. The project is located in the upstream of Nam Ngum 1 (NN1) and Nam Ngum 2 (NN2), and in the downstream of Nam Ngum 4(NN4) and Nam Ngum 5 (NN5).   Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. is the EPC responsible for implementation. Construction officially began on November 11, 2015. However, the project subsequently experienced significant implementation delays. Also of August 2022, the project had achieved a 79.8% completion. The project's originally expected completion date was in 2022.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan for the 480MW Nam Ngum 3 Hydropower Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In 2017, the World Bank was informed that EDL would sell a 80 percent equity stake in Nam Ngum 3 Power Project (“NG3”) to a Lao private company called Chaleun Sekong Group Company Limited (CSG). EDL and CSE, an affiliate company of CSG, then entered into an Agreement for the Sale and Purchase of the Share Capital of Nam Ngum 3 Power Company Limited on July, 26, 2019, which included the right of EGAT International Company Limited (EGATi) to purchase the shares of Nam Ngum 3 Power Company Limited under the Share Purchase Agreement upon approval from Thai Government. EGATI is the international investment arm of Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT). EDL reportedly divested its ownership in NG3 and NG4 (captured in Project ID#63452) in order to reduce its indebtedness.

The Ministry of Finance of the Government of Sri Lanka then used the proceeds from the PBC (loan) to on-lend to Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), which is a state-owned electricity company that controls all major functions of electricity generation, transmission, distribution and retailing in Sri Lanka.

CNPC holds a 60% ownership stake, and the Government of Niger holds a 40% ownership take in SORAZ. To finance Phase 1 of the Agadem Oil Project, CNPC borrowed $880 million from China Eximbank in 2008 on the following terms: an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 350 basis points, a maturity of 11 years (estimated final maturity date: September 2, 2019), and a 1 year grace period. CNPC then used the proceeds of this loan to on-lend to Société de Raffinage de Zinder (SORAZ).  The Government of Niger provided a sovereign guarantee for its 40 percent share of the SORAZ loan (equivalent to $352 million) on September 2, 2008. As of 2021, the loan had achieved a93.1% disbursement rate ($819,587,514 out of $880,000,000).  Phase 1 of this project involved the construction of the Soraz oil refinery in the village and rural commune of Ollelewa within Tanout Department and Zinder Region.  The refinery was designed to have a 20,000 barrel-per-day production capacity and to be fed entirely by oil from the newly-launched Agadem oilfield a further 700 km east.  The refinery draws crude from three Agadem wells with reserves totaling 480 million barrels.  Phase 1 of this project was implemented by CNPC and the refinery was officially inaugurated on November 28, 2011.  Also, in November 2011, the Nigerien Government commissioned the first of several audits of the upstream and downstream costs of the project. These audits, according to the IMF, revealed “inflated and undocumented costs” in the case of the oil fields, and “reasonable costs but significant space to improve efficiency” for the SORAZ refinery.  The Nigerien authorities also kept the price of gasoline in Niger artificially low, which hurt the refinery’s bottom line.  An IMF report concluded that the “audit findings [were] critical to give leverage to the Nigerien authorities in the negotiations for the refinancing of the $880 million SORAZ loan, an essential step to ensuring the viability of the refinery.""  There are multiple indications that the China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 of the Agadem Oil Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. The Nigerien authorities announced in 2011 that China Eximbank had agreed to reschedule the loan for Phase 1 of the Agadem Oil Project by reducing the interest rate from 6-month LIBOR plus 350 basis points (approximately 6.56% in the year that the loan was contracted) to 6-month LIBOR plus 304 basis points.  Then, in July 2012, the Nigerien authorities announced that China Eximbank had again agreed to reschedule the loan by ensuring that “the interest rate will not exceed 2 percent.""  However, according to SAIS-CARI, despite this announcement and the leverage provided by the audit report, the refinancing plan still had to be approved in Beijing.  CNPC still needed to get the approval of China Eximbank, and this reportedly did not happen. Then, in February 2017, an IMF report noted that “negotiations [for the refinancing] have stalled over the last two years” but that SORAZ now appeared able to service the debt “normally”.  Of the $352 million share guaranteed by the Nigerien government, $161 million was still included in the debt stock as of 2018, one year before the loan was due to reach maturity.  One year later, in 2018, the China Eximbank reportedly agreed to reschedule the loan through a maturity extension from 2019 to 2021. Then, in 2021, the Government of Niger publicly acknowledged in its ""Rapport General Public 2021"" that SORAZ was facing the possibility of insolvency and bankruptcy and had fallen behind on repayments to China Eximbank. It also acknowledged that the new, final maturity date of the loan (after the rescheduling) was August 8, 2021.  The 2008 China Eximbank loan for Phase 1 is captured via Project ID#73319.

The loan carries a 15 year maturity and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 6% margin. It is to be repaid by Epangelo Mining Company with future dividends from the Husab Uranium Mine Development Project over a 15 year period. The purpose of the Husab Uranium Mine Development Project (also known as the Husab Uranium Project) is to make Namibia the second largest uranium producer in the world.

Lahore, the capital of Punjab province, is Pakistan’s most populous and prosperous province with more than 5 million people. Pakistani officials expected the new transport system, the first of its kind in the country, to substantially decrease road traffic. Then, on December 21, 2015, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed three separate loan agreements for the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project. The first loan agreement is a $203.25 million buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement [ID#BC-OLL-2015 and ID#2015212493]. It carries a 5.2% interest rate, 2 year grace period, and 20 year maturity (captured via Project ID#53820). The second loan agreement is a $1,235,480,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2015) 34 TOTAL NO. (377) or ID#PBC-OLL15-34377]. It carries a 20 year maturity and a 2% interest rate (captured via Project ID#37280). The third loan agreement is an RMB 1,200,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) loan agreement [ID#GCL-OLL15-20559 or CHINA EXIMBANK GCL NO. (2015) 20 TOTAL NO. (559)]. It carries a 2% interest rate and 20 year maturity (captured via Project ID#54420). The proceeds of the GCL, PBC, and BCL were used by the borrower to finance a commercial contract between Punjab Mass Transit Authority (PMA) and CR-NORINCO [a joint venture of China State Railway Group Co. Ltd. (CR) and China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO)], which was signed on April 20, 2015.   According to the Government of Pakistan’s Economic Affairs Division, $672.7 million of the “mixed credit” (GCL, PBC, and BCL) from China Eximbank had been disbursed as of June 30, 2017.  The Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project involved the construction of a 27km two-lane metro bus corridor runs through the heart of Lahore along Multan Road, McLeod Road, and GT Road. Upon completion, the Orange Metro Line was expected to have capacity for 30,000 passenger per hour and serve 250,000 passengers per day.   CR-NORINCO — a joint venture of China State Railway Group Co. Ltd. (CR) and China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) — was the entity responsible for project implementation. The project was initially expected to begin by the end of 2014 and last for 27 months (estimated completed date: March 31, 2017). The project was ultimately completed on December 10, 2019. However, it encountered various problems and delays during implementation. The Lahore Development Authority began marking sites for demolition in August 2015, including government buildings, royal tombs, mosques, schools, and residences. Civil works were then initiated by CN-NORINCO on October 25, 2015. Popular protests prompted the Lahore high court to suspend work surrounding heritage sites in January 2016 while the court deliberated the issue. Then, in August 2016, the Lahore high court ruled that the government could not evict people or harm the heritage sites. The Punjab provincial government challenged the ruling, and in April 2017, the Supreme Court reversed its decision, allowing construction to continue under 31 conditions to limit the disruption and damage of the project. Then, in May 2019, a special audit of the project project was submitted to the federal government. The audit revealed losses to the national exchequer and alleged irregularities worth billions of rupees. More specifically, the audit disclosed that no framework agreement existed between the federal and provincial governments and that sub-contractors were granted several contracts without any approval. The audit claimed that a loss of $1,528,000 had been incurred to the national exchequer. It also claimed more than $1.4 million had been spent on the basis of favoritism with regard to project allowance.  There are some indications that the China Eximbank preferential buyer’s credit for the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the preferential buyer’s credit agreement for the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project.

The proceeds of the GCL, PBC, and BCL were to be used by the borrower to finance a $2.37 billion commercial contract between Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) and Shanghai Nuclear Engineering Research and Design Institute, which was signed on April 28, 2009.   As of June 20, 2017, $1.513 billion had been disbursed by China Eximbank for the Chashma Nuclear Power Project 3 and Chashma Nuclear Power Project across all three loan agreements (PBC, GCL, and BCL).   The purpose of the project was to construct Unit 3 and Unit 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant (or CHASNUPP), which is a large commercial nuclear power plant located in the vicinities of Chashma colony and Kundian in Punjab in Pakistan (exact locational coordinates are 32.390278, 71.4625). More specifically, the purpose of the project was to (a) construct CHASNUPP-III, a 315-MW two-loop pressurized water reactor (PWR), using between 2.4—3.0% low-enriched uranium (LEU) fuel with a gross capacity of 340 MW; and (b) construct CHASNUPP-IV, another 315-MW two-loop pressurized reactor with a gross capacity of 340 MW.    China Zhongyuan Engineering, China Nuclear Industry No.5 Construction Company, and Shanghai Nuclear Engineering and Research Design Institute were the contractors responsible for Unit 3 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. China National Nuclear Cooperation (CNNC) was the contractor responsible for Unit 4 of the Chashma Nuclear Power Plant Project. Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) supervised the work of all four Chinese contractors.  Construction of CHASNUPP-III (also known as C3 or Unit 3) commenced on May 28, 2011. CHASNUPP-III joined the nation's electricity grid system on October 15, 2016 and commenced its operations on December 6, 2016. It was officially inaugurated on December 28, 2016. Construction of CHASNUPP-IV (also known as C4 or Unit 4) started on December 18, 2011.

The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, an 18-month grace period, and an unknown interest rate. It is backed by a Sinosure credit insurance policy. The borrower is expected to use the loan proceeds to finance 85% of the cost of a USD 1.51 billion commercial contract between Angola’s Ministry of Transportation (MINTRANS) and China National Aero-Technology International Engineering Corporation (AVIC-ENG).   The purpose of the project is to construct and equip the New Angola International Airport (NAIA), which is located approximately 40 km to the southeast of the centre of Luanda, in the Bom Jesus commune, Icole e Bengo municipality in Luanda Province. The airport is designed to be an alternative to the existing Quatro de Fevereiro Airport, another international airport that serves Luanda. The new airport is being designed to have an annual capacity of 15 million passengers and 600,000 tons of cargo, with a 4,200 meter runway and 3,800 meter runway, and a 160,000 square meter terminal. The airport will also have 12 aircraft docks, a VIP passenger terminal, and an air traffic control tower.   China National Aero-Technology International Engineering Corporation (AVIC-ENG) is the EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Construction on this project began in 2007 under the management of the China International Fund (CIF); however, in February 2019, the Angolan Government announced that it had cancelled the contract with CIF. CIF was replaced by AVIC-Eng. Other contractors and suppliers involved in the project are Metallurgical Corporation of China (CTMCC), Dalian Zongyi Science & Technology Development, Fangda New Materials (Jiangxi), and Beijing Urban Construction Exploration & Surveying Design Research Institute. Angola's Ministry of Transportation (MoT) also appointed Mace Engineering Group as project manager and site supervisor for the project on March 27, 2015.   As of August 2019, the project had achieved a 60% completion rate, with plans to commission the airport in 2022. However, due to financial problems, work on the project was halted in 2019. Then, at the second Ordinary Session of the Cabinet Council, held on February 28, 2019, Angola’s Ministry of Transport was directed to conduct technical and financial review of the project in order to guarantee its completion, ensure better alignment with various ministerial departments, and establish a new schedule of actions. Then, in May, 2020, an addendum to the commercial contract between AVIC-Eng and MINTRANS was signed. At the same time, the parties signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) as part of the technical review work to adapt the quality and operational parameters of the new airport.   Work resumed on May 17, 2021. Then, on June 17, 2022, the airport organized its first test flight as part of a certification process and it was officially renamed Agostinho Neto International Airport. The project is now scheduled for completion on December 31, 2023. In 2017, China Development Bank reportedly also issued a loan for the New Luanda International Airport Construction Project (see Project ID#72349) but it was apparently replaced by the ICBC loan that is captured via Project ID#65402.

30068,"China (People's Republic of)","Sierra Leone","Africa",2012,2012,"CDB provides $1.2 billion loan to SISG to facilitate acquisition of 25% ownership stake in Tonkolili Iron Mine (Linked to Project ID#67499, ID#67503, and ID#92212)","On July 13, 2010, African Minerals Ltd. (AML) announced that it had signed a strategic, binding Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Shandong Iron and Steel Group (SISG) — a company controlled by the Shandong Provincial Government — regarding a $1.5 billion investment in the Tonkolili iron mine in Sierra Leone. It was envisaged that the project would involve a fully integrated mine with rail and port infrastructure, and it would be developed in three phases (stages).   Phase 1, which was underpinned by a $1.7 billion EPC contract between AML and China Communications Construction Company, Ltd. (signed on December 7, 2011), involved the complete rehabilitation and expansion of the port in the town of Pepel (within Kamasondo Chiefdom and Port Loko District), as well as the reconstruction of 74 km of pre-existing railway and the completion of a new 126 km narrow-gauge railroad (running from New Tonkolili Iron Ore Mines to the port town of Pepel), and the establishment of a major mine at Tonkolili (in the Sula mountains, in the east of the country). Phase 2 was expected to involve the expansion of about 30-million-tons a year which will take the mine’s production to about 50-million tons a year. It was also expected to involve the establishment of a new deep-water port facility at Tagrin Point, an extension of the narrow-gauge rail from the existing route to Tagrin Point, and an expanded production facility at the mine to produce a 64% high-grade hematite concentrate. Phase 3’s scope is unknown.    In August 2010, a mining lease for the project was approved. The project’s design and implementation was initially overseen by Tonkolili Iron Ore (TIO), a subsidiary of AML. Phase 1 of project development commenced and iron ore production began in November 2011. Then, in 2012, China Development Bank (CDB) issued a $1.2 billion loan to Shandong Steel Hong Kong Resources (a subsidiary of SISG) to facilitate its acquisition of three subsidiaries — Tonkolili Iron Ore, African Railway & Port Services and African Power — from AML (captured via Project ID#30068). Shandong Steel Hong Kong Resources used the proceeds from this loan to facilitate the acquisition of a 25% ownership stake in the Tonkolili iron ore mine and and related power infrastructure projects in Sierra Leone. On March 29, 2012, SISG successfully purchased a 25% ownership stake in the Tonkolili iron mine and related power infrastructure projects from AML for $1.5 billion. More specifically, it purchased 25% ownership stake in three project companies — TIO SL, ARPS SL and African Power (SL) Limited — that were previously majority-owned by AML.  AML said at the time that it would use the capital infusion from SISG to construct a railway line linking Tonkolili mine and the coast (see Project ID#20210). In 2013 and 2014, AML’s financial performance was adversely affected by a reduction in iron ore prices and an Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone. In light of these and other issues, and AML’s need to service its debt, including a pre-export finance (PXF) facility with Standard Bank of South Africa Limited (SBSA) and Standard Bank plc (SB), discussions began in the summer of 2014 between AML and Shandong Steel Hong Kong Resources (SSHR), over the timing of the release of a $284 million loan disbursement from CDB. In August 2014, both parties agreed to authorize the release of all funds to meet the liquidity needs of the project.    By the beginning of November 2014, $182 million had been released by CDB to fund AML’s working capital needs, but SSHR’s cooperation to effect the previously agreed release of the balance of $102 million was not forthcoming. Then, in December 2014, AML announced that due to insufficient working capital, the Tonkolili iron mine was being temporarily closed (山钢集团在塞拉利昂百亿投资遇挫).    During December 2014 and early January 2015, negotiations took place between AML and SSHR, with the involvement of the Government of Sierra Leone, over the sale of part of AML’s equity stake in the Tonkolili iron mine project to SSHR (or another subsidiary of SISG). An MOU between the parties was developed and initialed for identification only, though never signed. By early February 2015, SSHR had agreed the release of a further $19.7 million from CDB accounts, but there was no further engagement on the acquisition of AML’s equity stake in the Tonkolili iron mine project. The cash was applied to the payment of December and January salaries and taxes due in Sierra Leone, and some other essential payments to fund the care and maintenance of the asset. The remaining balance of funds within the CDB accounts was $82.4 million. Given SSHR’s refusal to permit the funding in the CDB accounts to be released, AML was unable to service the PXF Facility and defaulted on payments due under the PXF Facility in late November 2014, December 2014, and January 2015, in an aggregate amount of $31,249,999. AML then entered into negotiations with the PXF Facility lenders with respect to a potential sales process. While these discussions with the PXF facility lenders were continuing, on February 27, 2015, AML was notified that Shandong Steel Hong Kong Zengli Limited (SSHK), a subsidiary of SISG, had acquired all of the rights and obligations of all the existing lenders under the PXF Facility. On the same day, Standard Advisory London Limited, as agent, served a notice of acceleration on the borrowers of the PXF Facility of all amounts due and payable under the PXF Facility on the basis of the failure to make scheduled repayments of principal of the PXF Facility, and demanded the guarantee against the Company. Also, on February 27, 2015, the borrowers of the PXF Facility were given 31 days’ notice of the resignation of (i) Standard Advisory London Limited as agent and (ii) SB as security agent.   On March 4, 2015, Madison Pacific Trust Limited (Madison Pacific), a Hong Kong incorporated trustee services company, informed AML that it had been appointed as agent to the then security agent to conduct a sale process in relation to the Charged Shares. On March 31, 2015, Madison Pacific was appointed as replacement facility agent and security agent under the PXF Facility and continued to conduct the sales process in respect of the Charged Shares. By an application presented to the Chancery Division of the High Court on March 26, 2015, AML applied for an administration order on the basis that it was cash-flow and balance sheet insolvent, and that its center of main interest was in England. AML thereby submitted to the jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales. Mr. Ian Colin Wormleighton and Mr. Neville Barry Kahn of Deloitte LLP were appointed as the joint administrators of AML by the order of Mr. Kevin Prosser QC (sitting as a deputy judge of the Chancery Division of the High Court) on March 26, 2015 (the “Administration Order”).   Immediately following their appointment, the Joint Administrators sought to protect and preserve the assets of AML, including engaging with SSHK and SISG and Madison Pacific regarding the enforcement action and seeking orders from both the UK and HK courts. The Joint Administrators instructed Akin Gump LLP to advise on relevant matters arising during the administration, including advice on the enforcement action taken by Shandong. At the date of the Joint Administrators’ appointment, the sale process being run by Madison Pacific was already close to conclusion. In particular, Madison Pacific had announced that it was looking for indicative bids by March 16, 2015 with a view to concluding a transaction by mid-April 2015. The reason given for the urgency of the sale was the onset of the rainy season in April / May 2015, together with concerns apparently expressed to Madison Pacific by the Government of Sierra Leone that the mine should restart operations as soon as possible.    In their discussions, the Joint Administrators sought to understand the sale process better and to ensure that AML’s interests were being properly dealt with in the circumstances. The Joint Administrators also took the view that the sale process was subject to the statutory moratorium which had come into effect on their appointment. Subsequently, on April 13, 2015 in the absence of confirmation from Madison Pacific that it intended to observe the moratorium, and in the absence of satisfactory answers to their questions to both Madison Pacific and SSHK and SISG regarding the sale process, the Joint Administrators made an urgent application to the High Court. The application sought a letter of request from the English High Court to the High Court of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, where Madison Pacific and SSHK are located, seeking their assistance in giving effect to the statutory moratorium to that process. Although the English High Court was prepared to grant the orders sought by the Joint Administrators, the subsequent request for assistance from the Hong Kong Court was declined. The Joint Administrators were informed on April 20, 2015 that SSHR acquired the remaining 75% interest in the Tonkolili iron ore mine for more than $170 million on April 16, 2015. Full details of the sale were not provided to the Joint Administrators, but it is understood that the consideration provided by SSHR was effectively its agreement to repay the amounts then outstanding under the PXF Facility (approximately $170 million). AML was also discharged from its obligations as guarantor of the PXF Facility.   Then, in 2019, SISG halted mine operations after its license was cancelled by the Government of Sierra Leone. Then, on September 23, 2020, the Government of Sierra Leone through its Ministry of Mines and Mineral Resources, handed over the ‘new’ Tonkolili iron mine project to Kingho Mining Company Limited. The first shipment of iron ore from the mine (under the ownership of Kingho Mining Company Limited) took place in January 2021. Phase 2 of the project, which is reportedly being financed with a $2 billion loan from CDB (captured via Project ID#92212), officially commenced on March 6, 2021. Then, on May 15, 2021, the Parliament of Sierra Leone ratified a lease agreement with Kingho Railway and Port Company Limited, granting it the ability to manage and operate the infrastructure of the railway and Pepel Port for haulage and export of Kingho Mining Company Limited's iron ore out of the country. The lease agreement also makes provision for Kingho Railway and Port Company Limited to haul the commodity of any other company along the rail corridor under a commercial agreement.

54013,"China (People's Republic of)","Pakistan","Asia",2018,2021,"[CPEC, IPP] CDB provides $1.326 billion overseas investment loan for 878 km Matiari-Lahore Transmission Line Project (Linked to Project ID#53695)","On May 14, 2018, the National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC) — a Pakistani government-owned power transmission company — and Pak Matiari-Lahore Transmission Company (Private) Limited (PMLTC or Pak MLTC) signed an Implementation Agreement (IA) and a Transmission Services Agreement (TSA) for the 878 km Matiari-Lahore Transmission Line Project. PMLTC is a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and joint venture between China Chengxin International Ltd. (69.98% equity stake), China Excellence International Ltd. (30% equity stake), and the SPV’s directors (0.02% equity stake). It is responsible for constructing and operating an 878 km power transmission line from Matiari, Sindh (South of Pakistan) to Nankana Sahib, Lahore (North Punjab). The total cost of the 878 km Matiari-Lahore Transmission Line Project, which is part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and the Belt and Road Initiative, was $1,658,340,000. It was implemented as an Independent Power Project (IPP) — on a Build, Own, Operate and Transfer (‘BOOT’) basis — and financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20. The debt component is captured in Project ID#54013 and the equity component is captured in Project ID#53695.   On November 9, 2018, China Development Bank (CDB) Sichuan Branch signed a $1.326 billion overseas investment loan agreement with PMLTC for the 878 km Matiari-Lahore Transmission Line Project. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 10-year maturity length, a 2.25-year grace period (27 months), a 5.64% all-in interest rate (LIBOR plus 4.5% margin), a 1% upfront (management) fee, and a 0.2% commitment fee. Sinosure provided overseas investment insurance for this loan at a maximum rate of 0.60% per annum. The Government of Pakistan also issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan and a 17% guaranteed return on equity (ROE) to the investors in the BOOT project. State Grid International Engineering Ltd. — the overseas investment company of State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) — agreed to provide approximately $332 million in equity financing through two unspecified special purpose vehicles (SPVs). Financial close was achieved on February 27, 2019.   The purpose of the project was to construct an 878 km, 660 kV, High Voltage Direct Current Line (HVDC) that transmits 4,000MW of electricity (mainly from coal) from the Chinese bank-financed Thar Block-1 Integrated Coal Mine and Power Project (captured via Project ID#53674), the Thar Block-2 Coal Mine and Power Project (captured via Project ID#54314, #35127, and #54315) and the Chinese bank-financed Port Qasim Power Project (captured via Project ID#52904) to the northern parts of Pakistan (near Lahore). The starting point of the transmission line is at the Matiari Converter Station about 15 kilometers northeast of Matiari in Sindh Province, and the end point is at the Lahore Converter Station at a distance of about 40 kilometers southwest of Lahore in Punjab Province.  China Electric Power Equipment and Technology Co. Ltd. (CET) — a wholly owned subsidiary of State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC) — is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Under the terms of the BOOT contract, CET will operate the Matiari-Lahore transmission line for 25 years and transfer it afterwards to the National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC), the Pakistani government-owned power transmission company. A project commencement ceremony took place on December 1, 2018. PMLTC also issued a notice to proceed (NTP) to CET for the commencement of EPC works on December 1, 2018. The project achieved mechanical completion in October 2020. It successfully completed equipment debugging, sub-system commissioning, and station commissioning with a certificate of readiness for interconnection and a certificate of readiness issued on December 1, 2020.   The project’s originally expected commercial operations date (COD) was March 1, 2021, but due to delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the project ultimately reached its COD on September 1, 2021. The transmission line is currently operational. However, various problems arose during project implementation. On November 30, 2020, NTDC and PMLTC acknowledged that there was a defect in the transmission line, which emerged during low power testing. Additionally, the certificate of readiness issued on December 01, 2020, was later declared null and void upon the failure of the low power test due to frequency oscillation on December 2, 2020, and a notice of dispute in the matter was served to the PMLTC by NTDC. The matter was resolved between the parties through Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated February 18, 2021 without a declaration of the force majeure events and both parties agreed to extend the COD until September 1, 2021.   The project has also encountered debt repayment and financial management challenges. In May 2022, reports emerged that the Government of Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to PMLTC. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 14.5 billion (approximately $72.5 million). Then, in June 2022, the Private Power & Infrastructure Board (PPIB) requested that the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) make available foreign exchange so that PMLTC could make a $6.31 million Sinosure fee payment. In a letter to SBP’s Executive Director ofFinancial Market and Reserve Management (dated June 24, 2022), PMLTC noted a significant delay in approval by SBP of the $6.31 million payment request filed by the company on May 9, 2022. It also noted that late payment could result in a material breach of Sinosure policy leading to a contractual breach under financing documents. PPIB also noted that non-availability of requisite foreign currency could result in the lapse of consent under the Implementation Agreement (IA), which could in turn expose the Government of Pakistan to litigation. According to PPIB, pursuant to provisions of the IA, it is the responsibility of Government of Pakistan to make available through SBP the foreign currency not available through normal banking channels within the specified time for payment in foreign currency related to the projects, including the payment of premiums and fees to offshore insurers and reinsurers.   Then, in July 2022, Zhang Li (CEO of PMLTC) wrote a letter to the Managing Director of the PPIB, warning that the Government of Pakistan’s imposition of 17 percent general sales tax (GST) on transmission service charges (through amendments to the Finance Act, 2022 and Sales Tax Act, 1990) would have ‘severe financial implications’ for PMLTC. Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this “[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country’s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company",1445140765.68712,"The purpose of the project was to construct an 878 km, 660 kV, High Voltage Direct Current Line (HVDC) that transmits 4,000MW of electricity (mainly from coal) from the Chinese bank-financed Thar Block-1 Integrated Coal Mine and Power Project (captured via Project ID#53674), the Thar Block-2 Coal Mine and Power Project (captured via Project ID#54314, #35127, and #54315) and the Chinese bank-financed Port Qasim Power Project (captured via Project ID#52904) to the northern parts of Pakistan (near Lahore).The starting point of the transmission line is at the Matiari Converter Station about 15 kilometers northeast of Matiari in Sindh Province.

The purpose of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 750.224 km railway from Sebeta to Nagad. The purpose of the Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 329.065 km railway section from Sebeta to Meiso (Mieso) that consists of two subsections: a 113.836 km railway subsection from Sebeta to Adama and a 215.229 km subsection from Adama to Meiso (Mieso). The purpose of the Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 339.182 km railway section from Meiso (Mieso) or to Dewelle (Dewanle/Dawanle) on Ethiopia's border with Djibouti. The line runs from Mieso to the east — via Mulu, Afdem, Bike,Gota, Erer, and Hurso — to Dire-Dawa. It then turns to the north before reaching Arawa, and then runs from Adigala to Lasarat, Aysha, Dawanle and the border between Ethiopia and Djibouti.  The purpose of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project was to acquire 5 electric locomotives, 6 diesel locomotives, 30 railway passenger cars and 1,100 railway freight cars for the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway.  * Loan Disbursements: According to the Government of Ethiopia’s Aid Management Platform (AMP), the $1,289,029,000 (ETB 24,004,264,432) loan tranche for the Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project achieved a 104% disbursement rate, with China Eximbank making 14 loan disbursements (worth ETB 24,905,259,256) between 2014 and 2020: an ETB 1,062,992,126 disbursement on July 8, 2014, an ETB 5,420,000,000 disbursement on October 8, 2014, an ETB 2,303,030,303 disbursement on January 8, 2015, an ETB 5,597,115,886 disbursement on April 8, 2015, an ETB 1,808,159 disbursement on October 7, 2015, an ETB 1,740,583,177 disbursement on January 7, 2016, an ETB 825,731,677 disbursement on April 7, 2016, an ETB 2,165,153,034 disbursement on July 7, 2016, an ETB 143,690,666 disbursement on October 7, 2016, an ETB 923,238,863 disbursement on January 7, 2017, an ETB 325,274,645 disbursement on April 7, 2017, an ETB 372,159,087 disbursement on July 7, 2017, an ETB  1,422,471,270 disbursement on September 20, 2017, and an ETB 2,602,010,364 disbursement on November 12, 2020.

The railway begins at Sebeta, just outside of Ethiopia's capital of Addis Ababa. The city is served by two stations in its southern outskirts, at Furi-Labu and Indode. The line then runs southeast to Modjo and Adama, both towns located in the Ethiopian Great Rift Valley. At Modjo, a railway junction exists for the planned Modjo–Hawassa Railway. In addition, at Modjo the railway is connected to the Modjo Dry Port, Ethiopia's most important inland dry port and also Ethiopia's main hub for domestic and international freight services. At Adama, the railway turns northeast towards Dire Dawa. At Awash, there is a junction with the Awash–Hara Gebeya Railway, which is under construction as of 2018. Directly after Awash station, the line crosses 60 meters above the Awash River canyon over a 155 meter long bridge, the main bridge of the railway.The railway then proceeds to Dire Dawa, where it turns and heads directly for Djibouti. Crossing the Ethiopia-Djibouti border between Dewale and Ali Sabieh, the line reaches the Djibouti passenger terminal at Nagad railway station, near Djibouti–Ambouli International Airport. In February 2001; the Government of Ethiopia asked CCECC to inspect the line and propose a construction plan. This plan was put on hold for several years due to a lack of funding. After years of continued deterioration due to mismanagement, a 2007 pre-feasibility study indicated that the line needed to be renovated (at a cost of approximately $3.4 billion. The proposed renovation of the railway was designed to include a double track from Addis Ababa to Adama, a single track from Adama to Dewele, a 1035 meter long bridge, the grand bridge at DK42, the 155 meter Awash grand bridge, and a Labu station upgrade. Upon completion, it was envisaged that the Yaji Railway would run passenger trains (at 120 km/hr) and cargo trains (at 80 km/hr).   * Project Implementation:  Construction began in 2012 and the project as a whole had achieved a 50% completion rate by 2014.  Track laying for the railway began in May 2015.  The railway was opened for passenger services on October 4, 2016. Then, on December 31, 2017, Ethiopian Railway Company issued a project handover certificate to CREC and CCECC. The next day, on January 1, 2018, a ceremony was held to mark the beginning of the railway’s commercial operations. Two days later, in January 3, 2018, a two-way passenger train on the Ethiopian section of the railway went into service.  The Yali Railway was the first overseas railway constructed by Chinese enterprises that adhered to international standards (1,435 mm gauge line and electrification at 25 kV) and used Chinese equipment (CSR Zhuzhou for the rolling stock). The Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was originally scheduled (under the terms of the EPC contract) to commence on February 12, 2012 and reach completion within 42 months (August 12, 2015). It was ultimately completed about 15 months behind schedule (November 12, 2016).  The Meiso-Dewanle Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was originally scheduled (under the terms of the EPC contract) to commence on April 12, 2012 and reach completion within 42 months (October 12, 2015). It was ultimately completed about 14 months behind schedule (December 12, 2016). The Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Rolling Stock Supply Project was implemented between 2013 and 2015.  In April 2014, three diesel locomotives manufactured by arrived in Ethiopia by sea. Then, in October 2015, the ERC took delivery of 315 locomotives — that carry passengers and freight —  from NORINCO and Metals and Engineering Corporation. On December 13, 2015, 22 electric locomotives, 6 diesel locomotives and 6 passenger carriages arrived in the Port of Djibouti.   * Railway Operations & Management (Project Supervision and Control): On July 28, 2016, CREC and CCECC signed the Ethiopia-Djibouti Railway Operation and Management Agreement. The agreement specified that the CREC-CCECC consortium (also known as the CCECC-CREC JV and 中土集团与中铁二局亚吉铁路联营体公司) would manage the railway for 5 years (following construction completion). Then, on December 16, 2015, ERC and Société Djiboutienne de Chemin de Fer (SDCF) established a joint venture called the Ethio-Djibouti Standard Gauge Railway Company (EDR). ERC holds a 75% ownership stake and SDCF holds a 25% ownership stake in EDR. The main purpose of the EDR is to manage the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway (including the maintenance and renewal of all infrastructure and equipment) and to operate freight and passenger transport services on the line from 2024. The December 16, 2015 agreement specified that  CREC and CCECC would operate and maintain the railway for six years from the launch of operations and provide two additional years of technical support during the gradual handover of management duties to EDR from 2024.  * Financial Performance Problems: The project has faced financial problems associated with lower traffic volumes than predicted in the transport forecast and currency exchange rate fluctuations (as the project’s debt was issued in USD, but construction and operation costs as well as revenues are denominated in Ethiopian Birr or ETB).  It remains to be seen if the Yali Railway will find a path to commercial viability. The price of a railway passenger ticket was initially set at 30 Ethiopian birr (ETB). However, this price was subsequently deemed too high and reduced to 4 ETB, which means that the railway will generate substantially less ticket revenue than originally planned. Sinosure has reportedly written off $1 billion in losses due to the poor commercial performance of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway. In 2018, the Government of Ethiopia and China Eximbank agreed to restructure the project debt through a 20-year maturity extension and a 4-year grace period extension (see Project ID#61941).  The Government of Djibouti also requested a restructuring of its $491,793,000 buyer's credit loan agreement with China Eximbank for the 100 km Ali Sabieh to Nagad Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project on December 31, 2017.  The Djiboutian authorities reported to the IMF that a memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed in 2019 to extend the grace period from 5 years to 10 years, extend maturity of the loan from 15 years to 25 years, and reduce the interest rate from 3.409% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 3% [300 basis points]) to 2.509% (0.409% [2013 avg. 6-month LIBOR] + 2.1% [210 basis points]). The Djiboutian authorities also indicated that arrears on interest payments on this loan that had been accumulated during the restructuring discussion (worth 1.2 percent of the country’s GDP) had been restructured—and that they were integrated to the principal and expected to be repaid over the extended amortization period The new terms of the loan reportedly reduced the present value of the country’s debt-to-GDP ratio by 4 percentage points and smoothed total debt service. However, the final loan restructuring agreement (captured via Project ID#85163) was not signed until September 2, 2020. It not only codified the terms and conditions that were first specified in the 2019 MOU, but also sought to improve the performance and profitability of the railway in order to increase revenue generation. The restructuring agreement was ratified into Djiboutian law in February 2021.    * Operational Performance Problems:  Energy supply is not always stable in Ethiopia, due to the variable level of water in the country’s dams. The lack of stable energy supply delayed the start of railway operations, even after construction was complete.  ‘Overvoltage’ problems also led to repeated service interruptions after the railway began commercial operations in early 2018. This is a technical problem where surges in the electrical grid (due to Ethiopia exporting power to its neighbors) lead to overvoltage in the railway transmission line, akin to blowing a fuse. The railway line has also been flooded on several occasions, halting or delaying services. The Ethiopian Government claims that the standards used by the Chinese companies to build the railway did not take flooding into account. CCECC and CREC, however, argue that their standards accounted for potential floods, but that, in the flooded sections, tracks were stolen, causing structural damage to the railroad. Field interview evidence has also revealed a number of accidents involving animals (camels in particular) being hit by trains and killed. As the ERC has paid more than the market price for camels in compensation, there are suspicions that people are pushing their camels in front of trains deliberately. There is a plan is to build a fence along the railway, which should reduce accidents and enable trains to travel faster, from the current 50 km/h to 80 km/h. However, there is a risk that this may in turn create other problems, including interrupting paths used by people and animals. Railway service interruptions have also occurred due to protests, For example, in late July 2021, a group of Somali Region protestors blocked the railway line following an attack by Afar regional militia. The line reopened on August 3, 2021.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Government Agency",1454071828.83271,"The purpose of the Sebeta-Adama–Meiso Section of the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway Project was to construct a 329.065 km railway section from Sebeta to Meiso (Mieso) that consists of two subsections: a 113.836 km railway subsection from Sebeta to Adama and a 215.229 km subsection from Adama to Meiso (Mieso).

The loan carries a term (maturity) of up to 15 years and an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 3.6% margin. As a credit enhancement, the borrower purchased a buyer’s credit insurance policy from China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure). The proceeds of this loan were to be used by the borrower to finance up to 85% of the cost of a $4,532,114,041.00 commercial (EPC) contract that it signed with CGGC-Niara — a joint venture of China Gezhouba Group Corporation (60% stake), Boreal Investments Limited (37.5% stake), and NIARA Holding (2.5% stake) — signed on June 11, 2015. As of December 31, 2021, the $4.1 billion syndicated loan had achieved a 100% disbursement rate.   The project involves the construction of 2171 MW Caculo Cabaça Hydroelectric Power Station, which is located at the village of São Pedro da Quilemba, near the city of Dondo, in Cuanza Norte Province. This location is approximately 195 kilometers (121 mi), by road, southeast of Luanda, the capital and largest city of Angola. The project has three main components: temporary river diversion works, main construction works, and the supply of electromechanical equipment. The main dam will be 103 meters (338 ft) in height, with crest width of 553 meters (1,814 ft), creating a reservoir lake that measures 16.3 kilometers (10 mi) in length, with a surface area of 16.6 square kilometers (6 sq mi).  Upon completion, the power plant is projected to generate an average of 8,566 gigawatt-hours of electricity a year, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 7.2 million tons annually.  An official inauguration ceremony marking the beginning of construction was held on August 4, 2017. Construction was originally expected to last 80 months, so project completion was scheduled for April 2024. However, the project subsequently encountered various delays and problems. In September 2017, a corruption investigation by Der Spiegel, the Portuguese newspaper Expresso, and European Investigative Collaborations, an independent journalism centre, revealed that the daughter of President José Eduardo dos Santos, billionaire businesswoman Isabel dos Santos, is the beneficial owner of Boreal Investments Limited (a shell company that was registered in Hong Kong in 2012). Then, on November 5, 2019, the President of Angola formally authorized Presidential Order No. 79/18 (from July 12, 2019) which amended the EPC contract for the 171 MW Caculo Cabaça Dam and Transmission Line Project by removing CGGC-Niara and Boreal Investments Limited so that ‘the only party to the contract is China Gezhouba Group Company Limited (CGGC)’. Then, in May 2022, there was a major labor disturbance at the project site. Protestors ransacked the management offices at the project site and the police shot three workers. The workers were reportedly angry over low wages and poor treatment by their employer (CGGC).  As of June 2020, 90% of tunneling work necessary to divert the Cuanza River to the dam had been completed and 3.47% of work on the dam itself had been completed. Then, on May 20, 2023, a ceremony was held to mark the temporary diversion of the Cuanza River, which marked the beginning of the main construction phase of the hydroelectric power project.  At that time, the project employed more than 2,500 workers, of whom more than 81 percent were local, and the connection of the first generator to the power grid was scheduled for completion by 2026.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Commercial Bank","Recipient Government Agency|Other Joint Venture/Special Purpose Vehicle|Chinese State-owned Company",1463725268.56115,"The project involves the construction of 2171 MW Caculo Cabaça Hydroelectric Power Station, which is located at the village of São Pedro da Quilemba, near the city of Dondo, in Cuanza Norte Province.

178,"China (People's Republic of)","Sudan","Africa",2003,2010,"China Eximbank provides $608 million loan for 1250 MW Merowe Hydroelectric Power Plant Project (Linked to Project ID#695, #56927, #56959)","In October 2002, a joint venture called CCMD Corporation, which is between China International Water and Electric Corporation (CWE) and China Water Resources and Hydropower Engineering Corporation (CWHEC or Sinohydro), applied to China Eximbank for a loan guarantee before bidding on the 1250 MW Merowe Hydroelectric Power Plant Project in Sudan. On May 20, 2003, this Chinese consortium ended up winning three different contracts for this project:  (1) a $600 million (EUR 550 million) contract signed on June 7, 2003 for construction of the dam;  (2) a $60 million contract signed on December 23, 2003 for auxiliary projects related to the metal frame and hydraulic mechanics; and (3) a $400 million contract signed on December 23, 2003 for construction of substations and transmission lines. (Note: A $381.5 million loan for this project component is captured via Project ID#695).   On December 23, 2003, China Eximbank and the Government of Sudan signed three different loan agreements worth a total of $519 million in order to partially finance the first two contracts:  (1) a $400 million loan; (2) a $65 million loan; and (3) a $54 million loan. These loans carried the following borrowing terms: a 20 year maturity, a grace period between 6 and 7 years, and interest rate of 3-4%. China Eximbank later increased its total lending for the 1250 MW Merowe Hydroelectric Power Plant Project to $608 million (as captured via Project ID#178).   The total project cost is unclear but estimates range from $1 billion to $3 billion. Therefore, several other entities served as co-financiers. The 1250 MW Merowe Hydroelectric Power Plant Project was co-financed with:  (1) $250 million from Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development (and possibly an additional $211 million) (2) $150 million from the Kuwait Development Fund (and possibly an additional $50 million) (3) $150 million from the Abu Dhabi Foundation (4) $200 million from the Saudi Fund for Development (5) $15 million from the Government of Qatar (6) $106 million from the Government of Oman  (7) $575 million from the Government of Sudan  The 1250 MW Merowe Hydroelectric Power Plant Project involved the construction of a 9.7-kilometer-long and 65-meter-high dam with a total installed capacity of 1250 MW and a storage capacity at 12.4 billion cubic meters. It is located near Merowe Town in northern Sudan, about 350 kilometers (220 mi) north of the capital Khartoum. The project had 8 main components:  (1) Dam: This component included the construction of concrete and embankment sections of the dam on the Nile River channel. The dam crest was to be 9.7 km long and 10 m wide, and its height 60 m above river bed. The dam was also to include the appurtenant structures such as spillway, water intakes and sediment sluices, as well as a hydropower station.  (2) Preparatory Works: This component included the construction of housing facilities for construction supervision and operations personnel, the construction of 27 km access roads from Karima to the dam site, and a loading platform and storage areas at the nearby railway station. (3) Civil Works: This component included excavation, fill, drilling and grouting works, and concrete works for the dam and its appurtenant structures. It also included all civil works for the hydropower station, as well as all necessary instrumentation and monitoring equipment for the operation of the dam. (4) Mechanical Works: This component included the supply and installation of gates, pipes and related mechanical equipment for the dam and its appurtenant structures. (5) Hydro-Mechanical Works: This component included the supply and installation of gates, penstocks, cranes and related hydro-mechanical equipment necessary for the control of water, and operation and maintenance of the dam and its appurtenant structures. (6) Electromechanical and Electrical Works for the Power Station: This component included the furnishing and installation of ten turbines, each rated at 125 MW, and ten 150 MVA generators. It also included the construction of 500 and 220 kV switchyards, and the supply of the necessary transformers and bus bars, as well as control, protection and monitoring systems. (7) Transmission Lines: This component included the construction of 500 and 220 kV overhead lines having a total length of 1700 km, as well as seven sub-stations. (8) Consultancy Services: This component included the consultancy services required to review the conceptual design, prepare the detailed design, and construction supervision.  The project owner was Sudan’s Ministry of Irrigation and Water Resources’ Merowe Dam Implementation Unit. The contractors responsible for implementation included China International Water and Electric Corporation (CWE), Sinohydro, Harbin Power Engineering Company (HPEC), and Alstom, a French company.   The originally anticipated project commencement and completion dates were July 30, 2005 and July 30, 2008, respectively. The project began construction on July 8, 2003, and the first two generators were officially connected to the national grid on March 3, 2009. However, it was not until April 8, 2010 that the tenth unit of the Merowe dam was officially connected to the grid. However; issues with silt and debris accumulation threaten the long-term life of the dam. By 2020, the dam had lost 1.7% of its holding capacity.  According to a 2015 book (entitled ""Water, Civilisation and Power in Sudan"") by Harry Verhoeven, Dr. Sabir Mohamed Hassan (the Governor of the Central Bank of Sudan) has ""described one of the reasons for prioritising Merowe as 'the government needed something big to show to the people'. It was no coincidence that Omar Al-Bashir campaigned for the Sudanese presidency in April 2010 with a picture of himself in front of the Merowe Dam, the symbol of civilisation delivered by Al-Ingaz, as his main electoral poster.""  The project was awarded the Luban Prize, a master prize in the PRC for development projects. However, it was also plagued by controversy.  The project participants were required to prepare or contract an environmental impact assessment (EIA) in accordance with specific guidelines that address three major topics:  (1) Social issues -- consequences of people resettlement from future flooded area;  and (2) Archeological issues -- resulting from destruction or submerging important archeological sites or places of high cultural value; and (3) Environmental issues -- effect of large scale hydrological alteration of the natural river system with major impacts on the environment and water quality.   In April 2002, Lahmeyer International prepared the EIA report for the Merowe Dam Project. The report focused on complex resettlement issues involving about 7500 families. Among the environmental impacts it discussed were the hydrological changes, the erosion of the river bed and its banks, greenhouse gas emissions, and changes in the aquatic ecosystem. The 150 page report was far from meeting European or international standards, such as the guidelines of the World Commission on Dams. No serious attempt was made to use the vast scientific knowledge base on environmental effects of large dams, although four decades of research on the Aswan High Dam (Lake Nasser in Egypt, Lake Nubia in Sudan) had revealed a dramatic sediment accumulation in the upper part of the reservoir, problematic water quality issues and detrimental downstream effects such as river bed erosion or water level fluctuations. An estimated 60,000 civilians were ultimately displaced during the construction of the dam. Sudanese civilians protested the project’s execution from the start, and in a confrontation with authorities in April 2006, five people from a displaced community were killed.  There are also some indications that the loans that were issued for the construction of the Merowe Hydroelectric Power Plant may have underperformed vis-a-vis lender expectations. According to Sudan’s Finance Minister Ali Mahmood Abdel-Rasool, China Eximbank suspended its financing for 11 projects in Sudan following the secession of South Sudan in July 2011, which triggered a major loss of oil revenue (a key source of collateral for China Eximbank loans). Ali Mahmood Abdel-Rasool said at the time that the Government of Sudan had previously pledged oil revenues (worth 120,000 barrels per day) to China Eximbank as a source of collateral. Then, on February 18, 2012, the Chinese Government announced that it had agreed to reschedule the outstanding debt obligations of the Government of Sudan by extending loan repayment periods by 5 years (as captured via Project ID#30421). According to the External Debt Unit of the Central Bank of Sudan, the Government of Sudan's total arrears to Chinese creditors amounted to $3.864 billion ($2.608 billion in principal, $1.129 billion in interest, and $127 million in penalty interest) as of March 31, 2022.","Completion","Development","Loan","ODA-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Other Private Sector|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Government Agency|Recipient State-owned Company",1481126754.15015,"Merowe Dam is located near Merowe Town in northern Sudan, about 350 kilometers (220 mi) north of the capital Khartoum.

The Búzios oilfield is located in Santos Basin, southeast offshore of Brazil, with an average water depth of approximately 2,200 meters. It is the world's largest deep-water pre-salt producing oil field.   n August 20, 2021, China Development Bank (CDB) signed a $1.5 billion receivables financing agreement with FPSO Almirante Tamandaré (Búzios 6) — a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of SBM Offshore — for the Almirante Tamandaré Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) Unit Project. The borrowing terms of the loan are unknown. Then, on September 23, 2021, FPSO Almirante Tamandaré (Búzios 6) signed a $635 million bridge loan (facility) agreement for the financing of the construction of FPSO Almirante Tamandaré. The tenor of the bridge loan was twelve months with an extension option for another six months. Repayment was expected to take place upon closure and the first drawdown of the ‘project loan’.  Then, on January 25, 2022, SBM Offshore announced that it had entered into a shareholder agreement with Mitsubishi Corporation (MC) and Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK). MC and NYK acquired 25% and 20% ownership stakes, respectively, in FPSO Almirante Tamandaré (Búzios 6), leaving SBM Offshore with a 55% ownership stake.  Delivery of the FPSO Almirante Tamandaré was originally expected to take place in the second half of 2024.  The FPSO is being built under SBM Offshore's Fast4Ward program. The Fast4Ward program includes a new build, multi-Purpose Floater hull combined with several standardized topsides modules. SBM Offshore’s fourth Fast4Ward MPF hull has been allocated to this project. Under the Fast4Ward program, SBM Offshore usually orders an FPSO hull without a firm contract in hand, so that, when a contract is secured, the FPSO delivery time is shorter. The hull that has been allocated for the FPSO Almirante Tamandaré was ordered in China in December 2019. Once delivered, the FPSO Almirante Tamandaré will have a water injection capacity of 250,000 barrels per day and a minimum storage capacity of 1.4 million barrels of crude oil. As of May 2022, SBM Offshore reported that topsides fabrication for FPSO Almirante Tamandaré and construction of the Fast4Ward Multi-Purpose Floater (MPF) hull were progressing in China and Brazil.","Implementation","Commercial","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Recipient Joint Venture/Special Purpose Vehicle|Recipient Private Sector",1.5e+09,"This project financed a ship deployed to the Búzios Oil Field in Santos Basin, approximately 180-200km south of Rio De Janeiro.

Then, on December 16, 2011, CDB signed two bilateral facility (loan) agreements with KAZ Minerals Aktogay Finance Limited — a special purpose vehicle and wholly-owned subsidiary of KAZ Minerals Aktogay LLP, which is itself a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kazykhmys PLC (Kaz Minerals PLC) — for the Aktogay Copper Mine Development Project: an RMB 1 billion ($158 million) loan agreement (as captured via Project ID#39557) and a $1.34 billion loan agreement (as captured via Project ID#41941). The RMB 1 billion loan tranche (facility) and the $1.34 billion loan tranche (facility) were available to the borrower for draw down over a three year period. The maturity of each loan was 15 years from the date of first draw down and the grace period of each loan was 3 years. The interest rate for the USD-denominated loan tranche was LIBOR plus a 4.20% margin and the interest rate for the RMB-denominated loan tranche was based on the applicable benchmark lending rate published by the People's Bank of China (PBoC). KAZ Minerals PLC provided a guarantee for both loans. As an additional credit enhancement, the borrower pledged a $100,000,000 minimum cash balance in a charge account (collection account) as a source of collateral.  As of December 31, 2015, the RMB facility was fully drawn down. To protect against currency risks, KAZ Minerals swapped the interest basis from a RMB interest rate into a USD LIBOR interest basis. As of December 31, 2016, the USD facility was fully drawn down. Arrangement fees with an amortized cost of $15 million, were netted off against these borrowings in accordance with IAS 39. The USD facility was repayable in half-yearly installments beginning in March 2018.  The 2016 audited KAZ Minerals financial report identified the interest rates of the USD-denominated and RMB-denominated loan tranches as 5.12% and 4.33% (as of December 31, 2016) and 5.12% and 3.93% (as December 31, 2015), respectively. The 2017 report identified the interest rates of the USD-denominated and RMB-denominated loan tranches as 5.60% and 4.54% (as of December 31, 2017) respectively. AidData has used this information to estimate the interest rates that apply to these loans.    The initial development cost of the copper mine was $2 billion, with KAZ Minerals seeking to fund the remaining $500 million. The mine was eventually expected to produce up to 100,000 tons of copper concentrate annually beginning in 2015. The project was comprised of an open-pit mine and an on-site concentrator to produce copper cathode from oxide ore and copper concentrate from the sulphide ore, with molybdenum as a by-product.

He responded that 'I am cautious not to breach the confidentiality of the lenders, but generally speaking, the going-concern status of Eskom is informed by normal credit metrics — interest cover, debt service cover, and so on.

This agreement, which is popularly known as the loan-for-corn deal (or loan-for-grain deal), specified that China Eximbank would provide a $3 billion line of credit to PJSC 'State Food Grain Corporation of Ukraine' (SFGCU or PJSC DPZKU) — a Ukrainian state-owned enterprise — in two loan tranches: the first $1.5 billion tranche would be for the purchase of grain (through forward and spot contracts) and the export of grain to China, and the second $1.5 billion tranche would be for the acquisition of Chinese goods (plant protection products, machinery, elevator equipment) and potentially also the construction of biodiesel and corn processing production plants.   Then, on October 24, 2012, SFGCU and China National Complete Engineering Corporation (CCEC) signed a 'General Contract for Cooperation.' The contract specified that the $3 billion China Eximbank loan was to be repaid within 15 years with the proceeds from grain supply contracts between SFGCU and CCEC. Grain supply was to begin in 2012 (or 2013) and continue until 2027 (or 2028). The supply/sale of maize and other grains from SFGCU to CCEC was not to be less than 80 million metric ton over the 15-year period. SFGCU agreed to supply/sell 4 million tons in the first year, 4.5 million tons in the second year, and 5.2 million tons in the third year. Grain prices were tethered to futures contracts for the relevant period of time on the Dalian Commodity Exchange of China. The contract also stipulated that, in the event that SFGCU did not meet its annual grain supply commitments, CCEC had the right to notify China Eximbank so that it could in turn adjust loan disbursements in proportion to the annual supply of grain. SFGCU also granted CCEC the right to re-export grain to other countries for their legal resale. Additionally, under the terms of the contract, SFGCU agreed to buy various goods (including fuel, mineral fertilizers, plant protection products, seeds, agricultural machinery) and services from CCEC.  The contract further stipulated that CCEC would be the main EPC contractor for any turnkey project financed by the $3 billion loan agreement. The contract identified $1.5 billion worth of goods, services, and turnkey projects that CCEC would supply to SFGCU between 2013 and 2017: $275 million for the purchase of Chinese plant protection products; $305 million for the purchase of mineral fertilizers; $55 million for the purchase of agricultural machinery; $350 million for the purchase of seeds; $70 million for the construction of a plant for organic and mineral fertilizers; $70 million for the construction of a plant for the production of plant protection products; $195 million for the construction of an agricultural market center; $15 million for agricultural waste as alternative energy sources (pellets); and $165 million for the construction of a port elevator.

The final maturity date of the loan was December 28, 2027. The Government of Ukraine issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. In the event that SFGCU did not meet its repayment obligations, the guarantor (the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Ukraine) agreed to pay the amount of debt that was outstanding within 20 working days of receiving a written request from China Eximbank.   The full amount of the first tranche ($1.5 billion) was reportedly disbursed by China Eximbank and deposited in an account controlled by Ukraine Export-Import Bank (Ukreximbank) on February 6, 2013. The proceeds of the loan were reportedly used by the borrower (SFGCU) for forward grain purchases (i.e the purchase of barley, wheat, and corn from Ukrainian farmers intended for export to China). However, the SFGCU did not honor its commitment to sell 4-6 million tons of grain to CCEC each year. The SFGCU’s First Deputy Board Chairman Robert Brovdi said that his company had only exported 1.5 million tons of grain to China as of December 3, 2013. Other sources suggest that grain deliveries ranged between 10% and 23% of the agreed volumes. In March 2013, CCEC filed a complaint against SFGCU at the London Court of International Arbitration for failing to fulfill its grain supply obligations (and thus effectively defaulting on its repayment obligations under its $1.5 billion buyer’s credit loan with China Eximbank). Shortly thereafter, the Ukrainian media reported that the loan had been defrauded, and Ukrainian officials had demanded large bribes in return for declaring to purchase agricultural machines in China.   On March 11, 2014, the Ukrainian Ministry of Agricultural Policy and Food relieved Ihor Yakubovych, the Chairman of the SFGCU, of his duties. Then, in April 2014, CCEC and SFGCU performed a comprehensive audit of SFGCU’s implementation of projects associated with the $1.5 billion dollar loan. Then, in early September 2014, the Prosecutor General's Office informed Ihor Yakubovych that he and his deputy were suspected of a crime: misuse of credit funds (from China Eximbank) and deliberately creating the conditions for embezzlement of $15 million in cooperation with other persons. Several months later, in January 2015, the Prosecutor General's Office put Ihor Yakubovych and his deputy on a ‘wanted list’ for allegedly fabricating official documents and embezzling funds. According to an investigation undertaken by the Prosecutor General's Office, Ihor Yakubovych and the SFGCU Director of the Department of Trading and Sales purchased grain for loans obtained under state guarantees through fictitious enterprises and sold the grain below market price to such companies as SN, Trans Trade RK SA, RL Prosperis Commerce SA, Trans Trade RK SA, Apiq Commodities Gmbh, Ai Amal General Traiding Limited, QAM7, and GSteam. In 2015, China Eximbank and SFGCU amended the $1.5 billion buyer’s credit loan agreement in an unusual way. The amended agreement specified (in Annex 3) that, for every ton of grain exported by SFGCU to China, SFGCU would be obliged to pay China Eximbank a $5 ‘commission’ (above and beyond its principal and interest repayment obligations). Additional problems arose in 2017. On March 20, 2017, SFGCU was accused of attempting to illegally appropriate a privately-owned grain port terminal to increase its export capacity to China. Several media outlets also reported in 2017 that Ukreximbank froze SFGCU’s bank accounts at the request of China Eximbank.   Due to anticipated loan repayment difficulties, SFGCU and China Eximbank also engaged in debt rescheduling negotiations in March 2017. The parties ultimately agreed to reduce the loan’s interest rate from 6-month LIBOR + a 4.5% margin to 6-month LIBOR + a 3% margin. This loan rescheduling is captured via Project ID#85202.  Semi-annual principal repayments  commenced in January 2018 and the loan's principal amount outstanding stood at $1.2 billion in October 2019 and $900 million in October 2021.   Additional problems and controversies arose in 2019 and 2020. At the end of 2019, the National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) reported the detention of another former SFGCU chairman in Lithuania. Then, in early 2020, the Acting Chairman of the Board of SFGCU, Simon Chernyavsky, announced that law enforcement had opened 150 criminal cases against SFGCU officials. He also announced on March 2, 2020 that SFGCU was ordered by the London Court of International Arbitration to pay $4 million to CCEC. In August 2021, Ihor Yakubovych made an unsuccessful attempt to flee the country, but was detained by the National Police. In July 2022, China Eximbank was reportedly ‘playing hardball and threatening to send a default note on the loan’. This disclosure came at a time when the Government of Ukraine was seeking a 2-year moratorium on debt repayments to private and official creditors.  On January 23, 2020, SFGCU paid off $115.9 million on the loan issued by the Export-Import Bank of China: the corporation repaid $75 million of principal and $40.9 million of interest.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY, FISHING",NA,"State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Government Agency",1761185336.88876,"This loan supported the PJSC “State Food Grain Corporation of Ukraine.” Their corporate office is located at Kyiv, Saksaganskogo Street, 1.

Then, on July 11, 2012 and October 4, 2012, KRC and CRBC signed two commercial (EPC) contracts worth $3,804,192,784.92: (1) a $2,657,401,776.17 Construction on the Civil Works of Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project EPC Turnkey Commercial Contract on July 11, 2012 and (2) a $1,146,791,008.75 Supply and Installation of the Facilities, Locomotives and Rolling Stocks for the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project Contract on October 4, 2012. In August 2012, the Kenyan Cabinet approved the development of the railway, which was followed by the signing of a bilateral agreement by the Kenyan and Ugandan governments for the construction of the railway (that was later upgraded to a tripartite agreement with the Rwandan government). Less than a year later, in July 2013, the National Treasury of the Republic of Kenya and China Eximbank signed an MOU — that was witnessed by the President of the Republic of Kenya — based on the commercial (EPC) contracts that CRBC and KRC signed on July 11, 2012 and October 4, 2012. On May 11, 2014, China Eximbank and the Government of the Republic of Kenya (represented by the National Treasury of the Republic of Kenya) signed two loan agreements worth $3.604 billion for Phase 1 of the Standard Gauge Railway Project (also known as the Kenya Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project). The first loan was a buyer’s credit loan (BCL) [Contract No. 1410302052014210766] worth $2,003,584,028.87 and it was provided on the following terms: a 5.25 year grace period, a 5 year (60 month) disbursement period, a 15.25 year maturity, an interest rate of 6-month Libor plus 3.6% margin, a 1% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.75% commitment fee, a 0.75% ($15,026,880.22) management fee, a 6.93% insurance premium (payable in three installments), and a 1% default interest rate. The face value of the BCL was subsequently revised to $1,903,404,827.42. The BCL is backed by a credit insurance policy from China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure). The total cost of the Sinosure insurance premium is $211,543,142.85. The second loan was a preferential buyer's credit (PBC) [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2014) 13 TOTAL NO. (307) NO. (1420303052014210788)] worth $1,600,000,000 and it was provided on the following terms: a 2 percent interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 7.25 year grace period, a 7 year (84 month) availability period, a 20.25 year maturity, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% ($4,000,000) management fee. The BCL was scheduled for 20 semi-annual repayments between July 21, 2019 and July 21, 2029. The PBC was scheduled for 26 semi-annual repayments between July 21, 2021 and July 21, 2034. The Government of Kenya on-lent the proceeds of the BCL (captured via captured via Project ID#37103) and the PBC (captured via Project ID#31777) to the ‘end-user’ (KRC). The ultimate borrower (KRC) was expected to use the proceeds of the BCL and PBC to to finance 90% of the total costs of the two commercial contracts that it signed with CRBC on July 11, 2012 and October 4, 2012. More specifically, the proceeds from the PBC were to be used to finance 42.06% of the total costs of the two commercial contracts and be exclusively utilized to make payment for the ‘Line Section of the Project’ (i.e. the construction contents and items under the Construction on the Civil Works of Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project EPC Turnkey Commercial Contract). The proceeds from the BCL were to be used to finance (a) 31.95% of the total cost ($849,000,000 out of $2,657,401,776.17) of the ‘Line Section of the Project’ (i.e. the construction contents and items under the Construction on the Civil Works of Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project EPC Turnkey Commercial Contract), (b) 85% of the total cost ($974,772,357.44 out of $1,146,791,008.75) of the Supply and Installation of the Facilities, Locomotives and Rolling Stocks for the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project Contract, and (c) 85% of the total cost ($179,811,671,43 out of $211,543,142.85) of the medium-long term buyer’s credit insurance premium from Sinosure. The remaining 10% was to be paid by Kenya Railways Corporation to China Road and Bridge Corporation as counterpart financing, of which not less than $380,420,427.8 was to be applied to the Facilities, Locomotives and Rolling Stocks for the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project Contract. In order to facilitate repayment of its debts to China Eximbank, the Kenyan Government provided an assurance to the lender that it would guarantee a minimum amount of railway freight through the execution of a take-or-pay agreement between KRC and the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA). The KPA also agreed to levy a new, 1.5% tax on imported goods (called the ‘Railway Development Levy’). The Railway Development Levy was designed to serve as insurance in case the revenues generated through the take-or-pay arrangement fall short of the amount required to service the China Eximbank loans. The borrower also expected to use to the Railway Development Levy to finance the Kenyan government’s portion (15%) of the project (commercial contract) cost.    The BCL and PBC are secured by (i.e. collateralized against) project revenues that are deposited into a revenue account (escrow account) and a minimum cash balance in a payment account (escrow account). A 2014 Escrow Account Agreement between Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC), the Government of Kenya, and China Eximbank specifies that ‘KRC shall ensure that the following minimum amounts in [U.S.] Dollars [USD] shall be held in the Payment Account, so long as an Secured Obligations under the Loan [PBC and BCL] Agreement remain outstanding: (i) when the Loans are within the applicable Grace Period, no less than US$84,000,000, which shall be deposited into the Payment Account in the following installments: 1) an amount, of US$16,800,000, shall be deposited into the Payment Account before the first disbursement, 2) an amount of US$16,800,000 shall be deposited into the Payment Account before January 15, 2015, 3) an amount of US$25,200,000 shall be deposited into the Payment Account before July 15, 2015, 4) an amount of US$25,200,000 shall be deposited into the Payment Account before July 15, 2016; (ii) when any Loan [PBC or BCL] is within its Repayment Period, no less than US$250,000,000, and (iii) when the [BCL is] fully repaid, no less than US$80,000,000.' If the borrower does not adhere to its loan repayment schedule (runs arrears), the escrow account bank is responsible for withdrawing funds the overdue payment amount (plus 1% penalty interest) from the payment account and remitting payment to China Eximbank; then, the escrow account bank reimburses/replenishes the payment account with funds from the revenue account (where project revenues are deposited).  According to the audited financial statements of KRC, the cash balances in the escrow accounts were as follows: KES 0 in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333) and KES 1,000 (USD 11.4) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2014, KES 0 in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333) and KES 1,000 (USD 11.4) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2015, KES 5,981,587,210 (USD 59,217,713.37)  in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333) and KES 2,708 (USD 26.80) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2016, KES 8,713,702,264 (USD 85,394,282.18) in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333) and KES 72,472,503 (USD 702,983) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2017, KES 8,912,943,504 (USD 88,238,140.68) in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333), KES 424,026,583 (USD 4,197,863.17) in the USD revenue account (Account No. 1162573333), and KES 1,412,855,396 (USD 13,987,268.42) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2018, KES 9,078,451,382 (USD 88,968,823.54) in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333), KES 5,334,370,360 (USD 52,276,829.52) in the USD revenue account (Account No. 1162573333), and KES 1,567,057,226 (USD 15,357,160.81) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2019, and KES 9,195,200,216 (USD 86,434,882.03) in the USD payment account (Account No. 1162573333), KES 18,447,296,513 (USD 173,404,587.22) in the USD revenue account (Account No. 1162573333), and KES 2,991,272,808 (USD 28,117,964.39) in the KES revenue account (Account No. 1162574615) in June 2020. Given that the BCL was still in its grace period until August 11, 2019 and the Preferential Buyer’s Credit (PBC) was still in its grace period until August 11, 2021, the borrower evidently complied with the lender’s requirement that it maintain a USD 84 million cash balance in the USD escrow account while the BCL and PBC were still in their grace periods and the lender’s requirement that it maintain a USD 250 million cash balance in the USD escrow account while either loan was in its repayment period (as specified in the Escrow Account Agreement).  The borrower made principal repayments on the BCL worth $100,179,201.44 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and $200,358,402.88 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022). The BCL’s amount outstanding was $1,903,404,827.42 as of June 30, 2020, $1,703,046,424.53 as of June 30, 2021, and $1,502,688,021.64 as of June 30, 2022.   The borrower made no principal repayments on the PBC between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and principal repayments worth $61,538,461.54 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022). The PBC’s amount outstanding was $1,600,000,000 as of June 30, 2020, $1,600,000,000 as of June 30, 2021, and $1,538,461,538.46 as of June 30, 2022.  The Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) is the largest infrastructure project constructed in Kenya since independence in 1963. The Kenyan Government and the Ugandan Government first promoted the idea of the SGR in 2008 as part of a Northern Corridor Initiative to link the Kenyan coastal city of Mombasa to the landlocked countries of the Great Lakes Region. In August 2009, Kenya’s Ministry of Transport (MoT) and CRBC signed a memorandum of understanding, whereby CRBC agreed to undertake a feasibility study of the SGR Project at no cost to Kenya’s MoT.     In January 2011, CRBC submitted a feasibility report to Kenya’s MoT, which concluded that Phase 1 of the railway’s expected economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was of 14.66%, which was higher than the Government of Kenya’s ‘hurdle rate’ of 12%. However, the CRBC feasibility study later became a source of controversy. Its central conclusion — that the SGR was economically feasible — was inconsistent with the conclusions of previous studies undertaken by the World Bank and a Canadian consultancy firm. The CRBC feasibility study also included no cash flow projections. It asserted that the project would be highly profitable, but its estimates of the net present value (NPV) of the project’s expected economic benefits varied between $2 billion and $2.6 billion. The fact that the project’s estimated economic benefits were lower than its expected costs aroused suspicion about the credibility of the 14.66% EIRR estimate. The Government of Kenya’s decision to only allow CRBC to conduct the project’s feasibility study was also challenged by the Law Society of Kenya (LSK), which argued that Kenyan laws require competitive bidding for a feasibility study. However, a Kenyan court ruled in favor of the government, and stated that the whole procurement process was legal. After the award of tender for the whole project was issued without competitive bidding, sub-tenders did not follow competitive bidding processes. Two Kenyan parliamentary committees, learning of this lack of competitive bidding, recommended cancellation of the sub-tenders, but they were ignored by President Kenyatta. Then, in 2020, a Kenyan court of appeal ruled that the SGR contract issued to CRBC was illegal because it was issued in a manner that is inconsistent Kenya’s procurement laws. The court ruled that the contract should be made public, but a Kenyan MoT official said that making the contract public would undermine national security.     The purpose of the project was to construct a 485 km railway from the Kenyan port of Mombasa to Nairobi and then onward to Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and South Sudan. Upon completion, the railway was expected have a total track length of 609 km. The project sought to transport passengers and cargo from Nairobi to the southeastern port city of Mombasa at 120 kilometers per hour, thus reducing travel time between Nairobi and Mombasa from more than 10 hours to more than 4 hours. The project was also expected to reduce travel times and transport costs by as much as 60 percent. If properly implemented, the Kenyan Government estimated that the railway would increase the country’s annual rate of economic growth by 1.5 percentage points.   China Road & Bridge Corporation (CRBC) was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation, and Kenya Railway Corporation (KR) supervised its work. Project implementation commenced on December 12, 2014. The project reached completion on May 31, 2017, eighteen months ahead of schedule. President Kenyatta scheduled the completion ceremony just two months before voters would go to the polls and on Madaraka Day—a national holiday that commemorates the day when colonial Britain granted Kenya the right to internal self-rule. At the project completion ceremony, President Kenyatta gave a speech and said that ‘[our] history … was first started 122 years ago when the British, who had colonised this nation, kicked off the train to nowhere ... it was then dubbed the ‘Lunatic Express’. Today... despite again a lot of criticism we now celebrate not the ‘Lunatic Express’ but the Madaraka Express that will begin to reshape the story of Kenya for the next 100 years.’ However, the project has become a source of local scrutiny and controversy. In December 2018, a letter from Kenya’s Auditor General to the Kenya Ports Authority was leaked to the media. It suggested that the Port of Mombasa’s assets were sources of collateral that could be seized in the event that the Kenyan government could not repay its loans to China Eximbank. The letter also suggested that the Kenyan government had waived its sovereign immunity rights in order to make this pledge of collateral. The possibility that Beijing would seize a strategic asset like the Port of Mombasa provokes a public outcry in Kenya. President Kenyatta dismissed the criticism that the Kenyan government had mortgaged the Port of Mombasa to Beijing as ‘pure propaganda.’ He told a group of journalists that ‘if you want a copy of the [SGR loan] contract we have with China I can get it to you tomorrow. […]’. But neither the BCL contract nor the PBC contract was made public. In 2018, the SGR project also became a target of an anti-corruption drive by Kenya's Department of Public Prosecutions (DPP). According to Reuters, the “Kenyan authorities […] arrested the head of the agency that manages public land and the boss of the state railway on suspicion of corruption over land allocation for the new $3-billion flagship Nairobi-Mombasa railway. […] Mohammed Abdalla Swazuri, the chairman of National Land Commission, was one of 18 officials, businesspeople and companies named in a statement listing arrests that was posted …on the prosecutor’s office’s Twitter feed. Also arrested was Atanas Kariuki Maina, managing director of the Kenya Railways Corporation. […] The investigation that led to the arrests centers on allegations that officials siphoned taxpayer money through [fraudulent] compensation claims for land used for the railway.’    John Githongo, a former anti-corruption czar in Kenya, told a newspaper in August 2022 that ‘[t]he standard gauge railway is the jewel in the crown of corruption in Kenya.’ The secrecy surrounding the China Eximbank loan contracts that were issued for the SGR Project has also become a source of local concern. The Kenyan government has declined to make public the loan contracts in response to a court petition by two activists (Khelef Khalifa and Wanjiru Gikonyo), saying they have non-disclosure clauses and that releasing them would amount to breaching a bilateral agreement, thereby impairing relations between the Kenyan government and the Chinese Government. According to an affidavit from Kenya’s Public Works Principal Secretary Solomon Kitungu, releasing the loan contracts would undermine Kenya’s national security ‘since [the] terms in the contract[s] touch on foreign government information with implications on national security and foreign relations.’ Two activists—Khelef Khalifa and Wanjiru Gikonyo—filed a petition in 2021 at the High Court in Mombasa seeking to obtain all contracts, agreements, and studies for the construction and operation of the SGR. Through a coalition called Okoa Mombasa, Khalifa had previously attempted and failed to get the documents through Kenya’s Access to Information Act after the Kenyan government directed that all containerized cargo at the Port of Mombasa be transported inland through the SGR. This move reportedly had negative impact on the Kenyan coast’s port-based economy because it forced logistics companies to move their operations to container depots in the country’s interior. ‘We have a right to know the details of the project: how our money is being spent, the consequences of a loan default, and the government’s decision-making processes in signing the deal. Right now, we know none of this—the Kenyan public is completely in the dark,’ said Khalifa. Gikonyo, his co-petitioner, is the national coordinator for The Institute for Social Accountability, a Nairobi-based civil society organization.    Yet another concern about the project is related to its revenue performance. It was originally projected that the railway would move 22 million tons of cargo a year. However, a Government of Kenya assessment later revealed that the maximum amount of cargo that the railway could move was approximately 8.7 million tons of cargo a year. Also, one year after the SGR was put into operation, a parliamentary report showed that it cost more than double the amount to transport goods on the train than on the road. To make the railway profitable, the Kenyan authorities compelled importers to send cargo by railway instead of by road. This decision set off protests, riots, and court cases in October 2019 and November 2019. Then, on On December 4, 2019. Kenya’s senate committee on transport summoned the Kenyan cabinet secretary for transport over his directive to haul cargo from the port city of Mombasa to Nairobi exclusively by rail. The meeting — attended by activists, businessmen and leaders from Mombasa — ended with the cabinet secretary, James Macharia, promising to rescind the directive, which had reportedly hurt local businesses. Then, in September 2020  Kenyan lawmakers tabled a report in parliament recommending that the government renegotiate the terms of the China Eximbank loans for the SGR ‘due to the prevailing economic distress occasioned by the effects of Covid 19’. In the same report, the lawmakers recommend that the government renegotiate the SGR operation agreement, ‘by planning to reduce operation costs by at least 50%’. The SGR operators had to halt its passenger service for nearly three months due to concerns about the potential spread of the pandemic. CRBC operates the railway’s passenger and cargo service through its subsidiary, the Africa Star Railway Operation Company. In the three years the SGR has been in operation, Africa Star Railway Operation’s expenditure has always exceeded revenue, and the Kenyan taxpayer money has to fill the gap to sustain the company’s operations. A report by Kenya’s transport ministry tabled in parliament in 2018 says the railway made a loss of KES 9.8 billion ($90.3 million) in its first year of operation. At the time, the Kenyan Government projected a profit of $46.8 million for the following year. However, a report by the transport ministry in 2020, also tabled to parliament, said the railway recorded a loss of $200 million over the previous three years. The document also said that during this period, the railway generated revenues of $230.7 million but had operational costs of $430.5 million. The transport ministry cited reduced limited storage capacity at a Nairobi container depot, minimum use of the city’s freight terminal, and railway charges as reasons for this performance, arguably the kinds of details a thorough appraisal should have raised. The SGR operates both passenger and cargo services and while passengers embrace it for reducing travel time compared to buses, cargo owners shun it for reasons including higher fees and tariffs, additional time clearing goods and a lack of last-mile delivery, when compared to trucks. Kenya’s election in August 2022 became a vote on President Uhuru Kenyatta’s legacy of debt-financed infrastructure building, much of it built and financed by China Eximbank. This was especially true for the SGR.    The opposition party candidate Raila Odinga ran on a promise to renegotiate the Kenyan government’s outstanding debts to China Eximbank. Speaking at Chatham House in London on March 16, 2022, he said he would assemble a tough team of negotiators: ‘It depends on how you negotiate with the Chinese. If you don't have negotiators they will of course impose their terms on you.’ Several months later, in June 2022, the ruling party presidential candidate, William Ruto, told Reuters that he would publish government contracts with Chinese companies and renegotiate loans with China Eximbank. Then, in September 2022, newly elected Kenyan President William Ruto reverted cargo clearing services from Nairobi inland container depot (ICD) to the Port of Mombasa. The expected immediate impact of reverting port operations to the Port of Mombasa was a shift to road haulage and a reduction in cargo business for the SGR. Ruto’s predecessor, Uhuru Kenyatta, moved cargo clearance to the Nairobi ICD to help ease congestion at the Port of Mombasa and boost its competitiveness while also boosting traffic on the SGR to increase revenue for debt repayment. The effect of Ruto’s September 2022 decision was to shift more of the responsibility for repayment of the China Eximbank loans to Kenyan taxpayers.  In mid-October 2022, Kenya’s incoming Transport Secretary, Kipchumba Murkomen also said during his confirmation hearing that he planned to renegotiate the China Eximbank loans for the Standard Gauge Railway Project. He said that these loans were likely repayable over fifty years rather than fifteen to twenty years. He also said that ‘[I]f approved, I will look for the SGR agreement and make it available to the public because no one knows the contents of that agreement’. Then, in November 2022, Kipchumba Murkomen publicly disclosed all three China Eximbank loan agreements for the SGR project.  There are some indications that the SGR loans have underperformed vis-a-vis the lender's original expectations. In July 2022, the Government of Kenya received 'settlement notes' (an overdue repayment notification) from China Eximbank. Then, in October 2022, local media outlets reported (based on confidential Treasury documents) that the Government of Kenya defaulted on its China Eximbank loans for Phase 1 of the Standard Gauge Railway Project.

52904,"China (People's Republic of)","Pakistan","Asia",2015,2018,"[CPEC, IPP] China Eximbank provides $1.6 billion loan for Port Qasim 2x660 MW Coal-Fired Power Project","On July 24, 2014, China Eximbank provided a letter of intent to Sinohydro Resources Ltd. to finance the Port Qasim 2x660MW Coal-Fired Power Plant Project. Then, on October 16, 2015, China Eximbank and Port Qasim Electric Power Company (Pvt.) Limited (PQEPCPL) signed a $1,598,380,000 term facility (loan) agreement for the Port Qasim 2x660MW Coal-Fired Power Project. The borrowing terms are as follows: 14-year maturity, 4-year grace rate, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 3.70% margin. The Government of Pakistan provided a sovereign guarantee for the loan and a 27.2% guaranteed return on equity to the project sponsors (investors). Sinosure also provided credit insurance for the loan. These insurance fees amounted to 4% of total debt service (principal and amortized interest). As of October 2018, China Eximbank has reportedly disbursed $975 million through the loan.   PQEPCPL is a project company (special purpose vehicle) that was established in 2014 for the sole purpose of designing, financing, insuring, building, establishing, owning, operating, maintaining, and managing the Port Qasim 2x660MW Coal-Fired Power Project. The sponsors and shareholders of PQEPCPL are Sinohydro Resources Ltd. (51% ownership stake) and Al-Mirqab Capital (AMC) of Qatar (49% ownership stake). The total cost of this project was approximately $2.1 billion and it was financed with a debt-to-equity ratio of approximately 75:25. China Eximbank provided a $1,598,380,000 loan for the project, and the remainder was covered via $521 million of equity contributions from Sinohydro Resources Ltd. and AMC.   The Port Qasim 2x660MW Coal-Fired Power Project is located in the Port Qasim Industrial Park (exact locational coordinates: 24.7854°N 67.3695°E), and it consists of two modern supercritical coal-fired units, a self-dedicated coal unloading jetty and a 4 km-length channel dredged and transferred to Port Qasim Authority. The coal will be imported. The project, which is being implemented on build-own-operate (BOO) basis, is one of the largest “Priority Implementation Projects” under China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). The EPC contractors are Sinohydro Harbour Co., Ltd and CCCC Second Harbor Consultants Co., Ltd. A groundbreaking ceremony for the project took place on April 20, 2015. Construction then began in May 2015. On November 29, 2017, Yao Jing, the Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan, accompanied the Prime Minister of Pakistan to the power generation ceremony of the first unit of the coal power plant at Port Qasim. Then, on April 24, 2018, the project reached its commercial operations date (COD).   This project has been plagued by controversy. Transparency International Pakistan alleged that PQEPCPL and NEPRA colluded to set a tariff for the coal-fired power plant and artificially inflated the cost of the project. In August 2019, Prime Minister Imran Khan directed the formation of a committee to examine the causes of the ‘high cost of electricity’ and circular debt, and to propose a way forward to ensure ‘the future energy security of the country.’ The committee was given 12 weeks to complete the onerous set of tasks, which it concluded in April 2020 in the form of a 296-page report, titled ‘Report on the Power Sector: Committee for Power Sector Audit, Circular Debt Resolution & Future Roadmap’. The report claims that the cost of the Port Qasim 2x660MW Coal-Fired Power Project was artificially inflated.   Then, in May 2022, it was revealed that PQEPCPL was having difficulty servicing its China Eximbank loan (including a $70 million principal payment due on May 31, 2022) due to the fact that the Government of Pakistan’s Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) had fallen behind on payments (for the purchase of electricity) to PQEPCPL. Total payment arrears, at that time, amounted to PKR 91.2 billion (approximately $483,360,000). PQEPCPL, in turn, had payment arrears to its coal supplier amounting to $140,000,000. As of May 2022, the coal supplier had stopped providing coal for the Port Qasim 2x660MW Coal-Fired Power Plant due to large outstanding payments. PQEPCPL warned that ‘without urgent payments to restore coal supply, the whole complex will shut down shortly’. Documents showed that the Port Qasim power plant also sustained losses of $153 million due to rupee devaluation. PQEPCPL official reportedly told the Pakistani authorities that ‘[s]ince 2014, billions of US dollars have been invested, thousands of people have worked hard for seven years but today the company has no cash, low coal inventory, huge outstanding payments, a huge exchange loss, making coal supplier and operation and maintenance contract bankrupt and facing loan default soon.’   Several months later, on October 26, 2022, Sinosure informed the Government of Pakistan that it would not be able to provide credit insurance for any additional projects in Pakistan without ‘early resolution of [the] Revolving Account Agreement (RAA) pending between Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) and Chinese IPPs since 2017’. Under a November 8, 2014 CPEC Energy Project Cooperation Agreement, the CPPA and Chinese IPPs had agreed on the establishment of an RAA to facilitate the automatic payment of at least 22% payables to IPPs directly through the recovery of electricity bills of distribution companies (so-called ‘discos’). However, ‘due to various technical and financial constraints’, the Government of Pakistan’s Power Division acknowledged that the RAA had not been implemented over the previous 5-year period. In May 2022, an effort to establish an RAA was undertaken by the Government of Pakistan, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.   Then, on October 31, 2022, Pakistan’s Ministry of Finance came up with an interim arrangement for the Power Division to open ‘an assignment under the title of Pakistan Energy Revolving Fund (PERF) till such time matters pertaining to RAA are resolved’. The escrow account was to be opened at the National Bank of Pakistan and operated by the CPPA and PKR 50 billion was to be allocated from the Ministry of Finance’s subsidy account to the PERF with a monthly withdrawal limit of PKR 4 billion (against invoices from IPPs). The Government of Pakistan acknowledged, at the time, that this '[would] not fully fulfill the revolving account requirements under the RAA, but it [would] provide additional comfort to Chinese IPPs’. Then, in November 2022, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet turned down a proposal by the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) for the PERF (escrow) account to be operated by the National Bank of Pakistan. It decided that the account would instead be operated by the country’s central bank: the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). Then, on May 15, 2023, PQEPC served a formal notice of payment default on the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA). The total overdue amount that CPPA owed to PQEPC at that time was $263.5 million. PQEPC's power purchase agreement states that a failure to pay an undisputed amount by the CPPA within 35 days of the notice constitutes a power purchaser event of default. PQEPC demanded that CPPA make a principal payment of $73.6 million before May 31, 2023 to avoid a 'facility agreement default' as well as a Government of Pakistan or 'GoP default'.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company",1793822824.9036,"The Port Qasim 2x660 MW Coal-Fired Power Project is located in the Port Qasim Industrial Park (exact locational coordinates: 24.7854°N 67.3695°E), and it consists of two modern supercritical coal-fired units, a self-dedicated coal unloading jetty and a 4 km-length channel dredged and transferred to Port Qasim Authority.

61321,"China (People's Republic of)","Indonesia","Asia",2017,2022,"CDB provides RMB-denominated loan tranche for the Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Rail Project (Linked to Project ID#61320, #61322, and #96344)","The Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Rail (HSR) Project was originally going to be financed by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). In January 2014, JICA included the project in its Overseas Development Aid plan for Indonesia and agreed in principle to bankroll 75% of the total cost of the project at a 0.1% interest rate so long as the host government provided a loan repayment guarantee. However, Beijing was determined to win the contract for the HSR project and sought to outcompete Tokyo on several dimensions, including cost, speed of implementation, and level of public liability. In early 2015, Indonesian President Joko Jokowi invited China to submit an alternative proposal, and it proposed a lower cost version of the project that could be fully-financed with a government-guaranteed (CDB) loan at a 2% interest rate and implemented on a shorter timeline (3 years rather than 5 years).   Then, in September 2015, when President Jokowi was expected to announce the winning bidder, he surprised everyone by rejecting Beijing’s offer and Tokyo’s offer and “cancelling” the project. The stated rationale for his decision was that the project would lead to a ballooning of public debt. Tokyo responded by offering a 50% reduction in the amount of debt that would need to be backed by a sovereign guarantee. Beijing responded by scrapping the sovereign guarantee requirement altogether and proposing an off-public balance sheet transaction, in which CDB would work around the country’s public debt ceiling by extending a loan to a special purpose vehicle (jointly owned by Chinese and Indonesian state-owned companies) rather than the Government of Indonesia. Beijing’s revised offer was sufficiently attractive to seal the deal.   On October 16, 2015, a consortium of Indonesian state-owned companies (called PT Pilar Sinergi BUMN) and a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies (called Beijing Yawan HSR Co Ltd) established a joint venture and special purpose vehicle called PT Kereta Cepat Indonesia China (also known as PT Kereta Api Indonesia China or KCIC) to design, finance, implement, and manage the Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Rail Project. PT Pilar Sinergi BUMN (PSBI) — a joint venture of PT Wijaya Karya Tbk (38% ownership stake), PT Kereta Api Indonesia (25% ownership stake), PT Perkebunan Nusantara VIII (25% ownership stake), and PT Jasa Marga (Persero) Tbk. (12%) ownership stake — holds a 60% ownership stake (shareholding interest) in KCIC. Beijing Yawan HSR Co Ltd — a joint venture of China Railway International Co. Ltd., China Railway Group Limited, Sinohydro Corporation Limited, CRRC Corporation Limited, and China Railway Signal and Communication Corp. — holds the remaining 40% ownership stake (shareholding interest) in KCIC. Then, on May 14, 2017, China Development Bank (CDB) signed a $3.9675 billion loan agreement with KCIC for the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Rail Project.   The loan consists of two tranches: a USD-denominated tranche worth $2.3805 billion (captured via Project ID#61320) and an RMB-denominated tranche worth $1.587 billion (captured via Project ID#61321). The USD-denominated tranche carries the following borrowing terms: 40-year maturity, 10 year grace period, 2% interest rate, and no sovereign guarantee. The RMB-denominated tranche carries the following borrowing terms: 40-year maturity, 10 year grace period, 3.46% interest rate, and no sovereign guarantee. ICBC is the security agent for the loan. The borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance an EPC contract between KCIC and seven Indonesian and Chinese state-owned firms, which was signed on April 4, 2017. The total cost of the Jakarta-Bandung HSR Project is $5.29 billion and it is being financed according to a 75:25 debt-to-equity ratio. The equity contribution of Beijing Yawan HSR Co Ltd. is captured via Project ID#61322.   The purpose of the Jakarta-Bandung HSR Project is to construct a 142.3 km high-speed railway from the city of Jakarta to Bandung, the capital of West Java. Upon completion, the railway is expected to reduce the travel time between Jakarta and Bandung from more than 3 hours to less than 40 minutes. Construction began on January 21, 2016. However, the first CDB loan disbursement ($170 million) did not occur until May 2018. CDB planned to disburse another $1.1 billion before the end of July 2018. In May 2019, the 608-meter Walini tunnel was built. By September 2019, 32.8% of the project’s construction activities were complete and land acquisition progress reached 99%. By mid-February 2020, construction progress had reached 44% and land acquisition progress reached 99.96%. Then, in March 2020, the 442-meter No.5 tunnel was finished. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, work on the project was temporarily halted during the spring of 2020. Construction resumed in June 2020, and as of September 2020, the Director of KCIC Xin Xuezhong reported that construction progress had reached 60% and land acquisition progress had reached 100%.   The Jakarta-Bandung HSR Project, which was originally scheduled for completion in May 2019, has encountered a number of different problems during implementation. First, Indonesia Law No. 32/2009 regarding Environment Management and Control requires an environmental impact assessment (EIA) be developed over at least one year (and include analysis for both dry and rainy seasons) for a project of the Jakarta-Bandung HSR’s scale. However, the EIA for the project was completed in less than 6 months, and environmental NGOs claim that it contains inaccurate and flawed data analysis regarding the project’s actual environmental impacts. Second, the project reportedly violated Government Regulation No. 27/2012 regarding environmental permits, which requires public participation in the making of the EIA document. Environmental NGOs claim that, due to a lack of public participation in the EIA process, the project has serious design defects, including a planned route through numerous geological faults, which has led to delays, cost overruns, and local opposition. Third, although KCIC exclusively appointed PT Pilar Sinergi, a state-owned enterprise to deal with land acquisition issues, the process has not proceeded as smoothly as the Indonesian government had hoped. In July 2018, three lawsuits resulted in legal approval from the courts to proceed with claims seeking compensation for their properties affected by the project. Fourth, Indonesia’s Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing (PUPR) ordered a temporary halt to the project on March 2, 2020 after flooding blocked the main toll road between Jakarta and the city of Cikampe. Acting Director General of Public Works Danis Sumadilaga said piles of soil dumped on roadsides had buried drainage channels and caused the flooding, adding that shoddy management practices paid scant attention to health, safety, and environmental degradation concerns. Fifth, during the construction process, gas pipelines owned by the national Pertamina Oil Company were damaged, which caused an explosion and killed a Chinese worker in Melong, near Cimahi town. Sixth, blasting work for tunnels in the area of the Tipar Sari Asih housing complex in the West Java town of Cimahi has caused serious damage. According to Meiki Paendong, executive director of WALHI West Java, an environmental NGO based in Bandung, “[m]any walls of [nearby] houses cracked … [and] there was information that [the company] would examine the impact, but until now, the results of the inspection have not been made public.” Seventh, when flooding hit the Jakarta suburb of Bekasi in January 2020, Deputy Mayor Tri Ardhianto Tjahyono pointed to the HSR project as a cause, as did officials in the West Bandung regency which also flooded. Arief Maulana, head of Bekasi City Public Works and Water Management, said that “[o]ne of KCIC effects… is the problem of drainage control in several project activity locations, which are close to the drainage area that causes sedimentation and also disrupted waterways.” Maulana argued that it is the responsibility of KCIC to fix all drainage damage due to the project. KCIC eventually agreed to repair and restore the drainage system after the State-Owned Enterprises Ministry demanded an assessment of the project in March 2020, due to environmental degradation concerns. Meiki Paendong, executive director of WALHI West Java, argues that the flooding in Bekasi and elsewhere demonstrated that the project’s EIA was flawed, as it failed to address the closure and loss of drainage flows due to land-use change. For example, drainage canals were covered by landfills, which reportedly increased flooding throughout the rainy season.   In 2015, Indonesian President Joko Jokowi signed a decree prohibiting the use of government funds for the Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Rail Project. However, during implementation, the project encountered major cost overruns worth an estimated $2 billion due to various factors, including but not limited to higher-than-expected land procurement costs, delays in construction due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the rising prices of materials, and additional project insurance costs and debt service reserve account (DSRA) requirements. Then, in October 2021, President Jokowi reversed course, issuing a new decree and authorizing a government bailout of the Jakarta-Bandung HSR Project. The Indonesian government reportedly authorized the use of $286.7 million from state coffers to inject liquidity into PT Kereta Cepat Indonesia China (the borrowing institution) in the next fiscal year. It also made clear that it was prepared to provide additional funding on an as needed basis. At the time, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), said that ‘like it or not, … we have to ask the government to participate in funding the project if we want it to be finished on time.’ Then, in July 2022, the project’s prime contractor (PT KCIC) reported that the project had achieved an 85% completion rate. At that time, Jakarta-Bandung HSR saw the laying of ballasted tracks begin on its main line. One month later, in August 2022, high-speed bullet trains for the Indonesian Jakarta-Bandung HSR rolled off the assembly line in Qingdao within China’s Shandong Province. Eleven pairs of high-speed electric multiple units (EMUs) and one set of comprehensive testing bullet railcars were ready to be shipped to Indonesia.   As of August 2022, all Jakarta-Bandung HSR tunnels had been completed and more than 90 percent of the subgrade, bridge and station civil works had been completed. By October 2022, the project had achieved a 88.8% completion rate. Also, during the last quarter of calendar year 2022, Indonesian state auditor BPKP reported that the cost overruns associated with the Jakarta-Bandung HSR Project were just under $1.5 billion (rather than the earlier estimate of $2 billion). On October 18, 2022, Indonesia’s Deputy Minister of SOEs Kartiko Wirjoatmodjo announced that ‘[w]e are currently in the final negotiation with CDB for additional loans for cost overruns'. He also indicated that KCIC would contract one or more supplementary loans worth $1.03 billion (IDR 16.1 trillion) from CDB to cover approximately 75% of the project’s cost overruns (worth $1.45 billion). Then, on November 9, 2022, KCIC Director Dwiyana Slamet Riyadi told a legislative committee that the project’s cash flow would run out by the end of the month and China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) agreed that 75% of the project’s cost overruns should be funded with the proceeds of an additional CDB loan. At the time, KCIC was also asking parliament to make another IDR 3.22 million cash injection into the project company (as an additional equity contribution on behalf of PSBI) in conjunction with an additional IDR 2.15 trillion equity contribution from Beijing Yawan HSR Co Ltd. KCIC Director Dwiyana Slamet Riyadi told the legislative committee that completing the project by June 2023 would require receipt of additional project debt and equity by the end of November 2022.   On March 31, 2023, the track laying of the whole line of the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway was completed. Then, on April 10, 2023, Indonesia' Chief Investment Affairs Minister Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan said that KCIC had been working with CDB to lower the interest rate attached to the supplementary loan to cover the project's cost overruns. The Indonesian Government proposed a $560 million loan at a 2%interest rate from China Development Bank (CDB) to pay for the cost overruns. In April 2023, Luhut told a press briefing in Jakarta that '[CDB] is already willing to bring the interest down from 4 percent. The first offer is a reduction from 4 percent to 3.4 percent, but we want it to be even lower. [...] We do want a 2 percent interest, but it is impossible to have everything [we want] come true. If you ask for loans [outside China], the interest can go up to 6 percent. So if we end up with a 3.4-percent rate, we are doing okay, although not that okay. But that would be better than [borrowing money from other countries].' Luhut also noted that a 3.4 percent interest rate would not necessarily be problematic: 'Do not underestimate our country. We are getting better. Our state tax revenue has grown by 48.6 percent [in January 2023] thanks to better efficiency with digitalization, etc.'  As of April 2023, the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway was expected to launch its commercial operations on August 18, 2023 — one day after the 78th anniversary of Indonesia's independence day.  Then, in May 2023, Indonesia’s Transport Ministry and three consulting firms -- Mott MacDonald, PwC and local law firm Umbra -- pushed back on the suggestion that the project could achieve full-fledged commercial operations by August 18, 2023. At the time, the Chinese participants in KCIC reportedly wanted a full operational worthiness certificate for the Jakarta-Bandung HSC despite the incomplete construction of a railway station, but the Indonesian Transport Ministry and its consultants suggested that KCIC might not achieve full-fledged commercial operations until December 31, 2023.   Then, in June 2023, Reuters reported that KCIC was still in negotiations with CDB over a $560 million supplemental loan (captured via captured via Project ID#96344). After CDB offered an interest rate of 3.46% on the loan's RMB-denominated tranche, KCIC reportedly countered with a 2.8% interest rate request.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Other Joint Venture/Special Purpose Vehicle",1828760655.19228,"The purpose of the project is to construct a 142.3 km high-speed railway from the city of Jakarta to Bandung, the capital of West Java.

The borrowing terms of this loan were as follows: a 20 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, and a 4.5% interest rate. Then, on June 14, 2011, China Development Bank, Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC), and Myanmar Foreign Trade Bank (MFTB) signed a loan agreement for Phase 2A and 3 of the Myingyan No. 1 Steel Mill Construction Project. The borrowing terms of this loan were as follows: a 21 year maturity, a 6 year grace period, and a 5% interest rate.   The precise face values of the 2010 and 2011 loans are unknown. However, according to a Government of Myanmar General Statistical Report and a Mandalay Regional Auditor General's Report (covering the period April 2018 to September 2018), total CDB disbursements for the project amounted to EUR 1,042,340,000 (EUR 566.97 million euros when the steel mill was under MEC ownership and EUR 475.37 million during the period when Myanmar’s Ministry of Industry was responsible for the steel mill).   The CDB loan repayment period for Phase 2 of the project runs from FY2015-16 to 2030-31. The CDB loan repayment period for Phase 2A and Phase 3 of the project is FY2017-18 to 2032-33. The total principal and interest outstanding under the two CDB loans was EUR 1.615 billion as of 2020.  The purpose of the project was to construct a steel mill — with the capacity to produce 400,000 tons per year of steel, steel products, construction materials, and machinery materials — near Sar Khar Village within Myingyan Township and the Mandalay Region (approximately 3.3 miles west of milepost 450/0 on the Yangon Myingyan Highway).   The project was implemented in three phases. Phase 1 commenced operations in March 2010 and it reportedly reached completion. However, it does not appear that Phase 2 or 3 (which were designed to produce value added products) ever reached completion. Responsibility for the steel mill was transferred from MEC to Myanmar’s Minstry of Industry on October 1, 2012.   There are some indications that the CDB loans for Myingyan No. 1 Steel Mill Construction Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. The mill was shuttered on February 17, 2017 because it was consistently losing money. Then, in 2020, the Acting Mandalay Chief Minister stated that the total project debt including interest exceeded EUR 1.615 billion. Consequently, the Government of Myanmar found itself in the position of having to pay 500 million kyats ($345,000) a day to CDB to service a loan contracted by a military-backed conglomerate (MEC) for a steel mill that was no longer operational. In 2020, CDB and the Government of Myanmar signed a debt suspension agreement as part of the G-20 Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI). Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between May 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under 5 loan agreements (as captured via Project ID#98030).  Debt service payments under these loan agreements were again deferred in 2021 (as captured via Project ID#98031).  On August 16, 2021, the military junta-appointed Minister of Industry, Dr. Charlie Than, visited the project site and announced that work at the steel mill would commence 'as soon as possible' (at the instruction of coup leader Min Aung Hlaing). A Yangon-based observer monitoring investment projects in the country noted at the time that the military regime was rapidly resuming Chinese-financed projects -- paused by the [National League for Democracy (NLD) government] -- to prove that it could make the initiatives profitable: 'They are doing that intentionally and for political purposes. They want to say that they are able to do it even though the previous civilian government suspended it,' the observer said.","Implementation","Development","Loan","ODA-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank",NA,1922660231.18867,"The purpose of the project was to construct a steel mill — with the capacity to produce 400,000 tons per year of steel, steel products, construction materials, and machinery materials — near Sar Khar Village within Myingyan Township and the Mandalay Region (approximately 3.3 miles west of milepost 450/0 on the Yangon Myingyan Highway).

Amid a difficult market environment, the financing was well oversubscribed, underpinned by a well-developed commercial structure designed to ensure an acceptable risk-sharing mechanism between the project and the financiers. The ECA negotiation process began in January 2009 and commercial banks were invited to submit financing proposals in July/August 2009. The debt package consisted of US$4.6 billion in commercial tranches, US$5.7 billion of direct lending from ECAs and a US$3.8 billion loan from the sponsor, ExxonMobil.   The 17 banks that participated in the syndication of the commercial tranches were ANZ, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, BNP Paribas, Calyon, China Development Bank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Crédit Industriel et Commercial de Paris, DnB Bank ASA, Intesa Sanpaolo, Mizuho Corporate Bank, National Australia Bank, Natixis, Société Générale (SG), Standard Chartered Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, UniCredit and Westpac Banking Corporation. SG and Sullivan & Cromwell were appointed financial adviser and international legal adviser in early 2008.   The commercial tranches were divided into a US$1.95 billion uncovered term loan, US$800 million term loan guaranteed by Export-Import Bank of the US (US Eximbank), US$900 million guaranteed facility by the Italian ECA Servizi Assicurativi del Commercio Estero (SACE), and a US$950 million facility insured by Nippon Export and Investment Insurance (NEXI). China Development Bank contributed US$600 million (captured via Project ID#61186) to the US$1.95 billion uncovered term loan.

All facilities have a tenor of 17 years, except for the US$1.95 billion uncovered tranche, which has a maturity of 15 years. The interest rate is unknown.   On October 4, 2013, an additional syndicated loan facility of USD 1.5 billion was committed to fund the increased project construction cost. The debt consists of a USD$600 million term loan provided by a consortium of 10 banks, including $120 million USD from China Development Bank ((captured via Project#61187), and a USD $900 million sponsor loan from ExxonMobil. The loan has a maturity length of 13 years 6 months.    The purpose of the PNG Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project was to build gas production and processing facilities, onshore and offshore pipelines and liquefaction facilities in PNG with the capacity to produce 6.6 million tons of LNG per year.  The main components of the project include (1) an LNG plant (that consists of two LNG process trains, two 160,000 cubic meter LNG storage tanks, a marine loading terminal for LNG tankers up to 215,000 cubic meters, camp facilities, including accommodation and amenities, administration office, medical center, emergency helipad and sport and recreation center); (2) the Hides Gas Conditioning Plant (HGCP); and (3) a 700 km pipeline that transports natural gas from the Hides Gas Conditioning Plant to the LNG plant.   The LNG Plant is located 20 kilometers northwest of Port Moresby, at Caution Bay on the south coast of PNG’s Central Province. The LNG process involves removing impurities and cooling the gas down to a temperature cold enough to turn it into liquid form. Once achieved, the LNG is moved to specialized storage tanks. From there, the LNG goes through a pipeline connected to the jetty where it loads onto LNG carriers. These ships then export the LNG to the international market. The operation has the capacity to produce more than 8.3 million tonnes of LNG annually, an increase of 20 percent from the original design specification of 6.9 million tonnes per annum (MTA).   Condensate, a low-density mixture of hydrocarbon liquids recovered through the gas liquefaction process, is also stored and loaded onto tankers for export at the LNG Plant. The Hides Gas Conditioning Plant (HGCP) is located just outside of the township of Hides in PNG’s Hela Province. The plant processes up to 1 billion standard cubic feet of gas gathered from eight wells each day. At the plant, gas, condensate and water are separated and treated before being sent via separate pipelines to other facilities in PNG for further handling.The gas is transported along a 700-kilometre-long pipeline to the LNG Plant near Port Moresby where it is converted into liquid form, ready for shipping. Around 30,000 barrels of condensate is also produced at the Plant daily. After separation, the condensate is directed along its own pipeline to the Kutubu Central Processing Facility and later the Kumul terminal for export.   These production demands are met by more than 450 production staff who work around the clock every day of the year. Conditioned gas is transported from the Hides Gas Conditioning Plant (HGCP) in the Highlands to the LNG Plant just outside of Port Moresby via a state-of-the-art 700-kilometre-long pipeline. The pipeline includes an onshore and an offshore portion. The onshore section of pipe has a diameter between 32 and 34 inches and is buried one metre below ground. It travels a distance of 290 kilometers from the HGCP all the way down to the Omati River. The offshore section of pipe joins the onshore section at the Omati River and extends a further 407 kilometers to the LNG Plant. The offshore segment travels approximately 24 kilometers past Goaribari Island to the open sea, then across the Gulf of Papua to the Caution Bay landfall at the LNG Plant.   ExxonMobil PNG Limited, a subsidiary of ExxonMobil, is the is the entity responsible for operating the PNG Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project. In 2008, the initial PNG LNG Project partners signed a joint operating agreement. In that same year, an independent Economic Impact Study was commissioned and showed that the Project would have a significant impact on the GDP of Papua New Guinea, in addition to other benefits such as employment and business opportunities. Then, on Mary 22, 2008, the project venture participants and the the Government of Papua New Guinea formally signed the Gas Agreement, which established the fiscal regime and legal framework by which the PNG LNG Project is to be regulated throughout its lifetime and set the terms and mechanism for State equity participation in the Project. Following this, it was announced that the project would enter Front End Engineering and Design (FEED).   Between December 2009 and March 2010, sales and marketing agreements for the gas were signed with four major customers. An Environmental Impact Statement, which draws upon 26 supporting studies and took two years to complete, was approved by the PNG Government in October 2009. This documented the many rigorous commitments and measures the project would take to manage environmental risks.   On December 8, 2009 the project venture participants approved the project, paving the way for construction to begin. This was supported by the completion of financing arrangements with lenders in March 2010. Engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contracts were approved in late 2009 and in early 2010 construction work began. On or around April 29, 2014, the PNG LNG Project started production of liquefied natural gas ahead of schedule. Then, on May 25, 2014, the first shipment of liquefied natural gas from the PNG LNG Project was delivered by the Spirit of Hela to the Tokyo Electric Power Co. Inc. (TEPCO) in Japan. Chinese state-owned oil company, Sinopec, also signed an agreement (on December 3, 2019), with ExxonMobil to purchase 2 million tons of LNG annually from the PNG LNG project.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Other Private Sector",1952613062.75722,"The purpose of the PNG Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project was to build gas production and processing facilities, onshore and offshore pipelines and liquefaction facilities in PNG with the capacity to produce 6.6 million tons of LNG per year.

The BCL carried the following borrowing terms: a 19.5-year repayment period, a 4% interest rate, and an unknown grace period.   The proceeds of the BCL were used to partially finance the $1.154 billion commercial contract signed on February 28, 2007 with China Railway Engineering Group Co. Ltd. and China Railway Erju Co. Ltd. Unit Transtech Engineering Corporation.  The project involved constructing a 762 km railway line from Port Sudan to Khartoum via Atbara. It also involved the provision of electric multiple units (EMUs) from CSR Ziyang Locomotive Co., Ltd. and Shanghai Electric Company.   A groundbreaking ceremony for the Atbara to Port Sudan portion of the railway was held on February 20, 2013, and a formal project handover ceremony for the Khartoum to Atbara portion of the railway was held on January 20, 2014.   There are some indications that the China Eximbank loan issued for the Khartoum-Port Sudan Railway Construction Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis lender expectations. In August 2010, the Economic and Commercial Counsellor's Office of the Chinese Embassy in Sudan reported that the project had been stagnant due to the Government of Sudan's inability to make loan repayments. Then, according to Sudan’s Finance Minister Ali Mahmood Abdel-Rasool, China Eximbank suspended its financing for 11 projects in Sudan following the secession of South Sudan in July 2011, which triggered a major loss of oil revenue (a key source of collateral for China Eximbank loans). Ali Mahmood Abdel-Rasool said at the time that the Government of Sudan had previously pledged oil revenues (worth 120,000 barrels per day) to China Eximbank as a source of collateral. Then, on February 18, 2012, the Chinese Government announced that it had agreed to reschedule the outstanding debt obligations of the Government of Sudan by extending loan repayment periods by 5 years (as captured via Project ID#30421). According to the External Debt Unit of the Central Bank of Sudan, the Government of Sudan's total arrears to Chinese creditors amounted to $3.864 billion ($2.608 billion in principal, $1.129 billion in interest, and $127 million in penalty interest) as of March 31, 2022.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient Government Agency",1975831018.80506,"This project involved the construction of a 762 km railway line from Port Sudan to Khartoum via Atbara.

Then, on July 11, 2012 and October 4, 2012, KRC and CRBC signed two commercial (EPC) contracts worth $3,804,192,784.92: (1) a $2,657,401,776.17 Construction on the Civil Works of Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project EPC Turnkey Commercial Contract on July 11, 2012 and (2) a $1,146,791,008.75 Supply and Installation of the Facilities, Locomotives and Rolling Stocks for the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project Contract on October 4, 2012. In August 2012, the Kenyan Cabinet approved the development of the railway, which was followed by the signing of a bilateral agreement by the Kenyan and Ugandan governments for the construction of the railway (that was later upgraded to a tripartite agreement with the Rwandan government). Less than a year later, in July 2013, the National Treasury of the Republic of Kenya and China Eximbank signed an MOU — that was witnessed by the President of the Republic of Kenya — based on the commercial (EPC) contracts that CRBC and KRC signed on July 11, 2012 and October 4, 2012. On May 11, 2014, China Eximbank and the Government of the Republic of Kenya (represented by the National Treasury of the Republic of Kenya) signed two loan agreements worth $3.604 billion for Phase 1 of the Standard Gauge Railway Project (also known as the Kenya Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project). The first loan was a buyer’s credit loan (BCL) [Contract No. 1410302052014210766] worth $2,003,584,028.87 and it was provided on the following terms: a 5.25 year grace period, a 5 year (60 month) disbursement period, a 15.25 year maturity, an interest rate of 6-month Libor plus 3.6% margin, a 1% default (penalty) interest rate, a 0.75% commitment fee, a 0.75% ($15,026,880.22) management fee, a 6.93% insurance premium (payable in three installments), and a 1% default interest rate. The face value of the BCL was subsequently revised to $1,903,404,827.42. The BCL is backed by a credit insurance policy from China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure). The total cost of the Sinosure insurance premium is $211,543,142.85. The second loan was a preferential buyer's credit (PBC) [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2014) 13 TOTAL NO. (307) NO. (1420303052014210788)] worth $1,600,000,000 and it was provided on the following terms: a 2 percent interest rate, a 0% default (penalty) interest rate, a 7.25 year grace period, a 7 year (84 month) availability period, a 20.25 year maturity, a 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% ($4,000,000) management fee. The BCL was scheduled for 20 semi-annual repayments between July 21, 2019 and July 21, 2029. The PBC was scheduled for 26 semi-annual repayments between July 21, 2021 and July 21, 2034. The Government of Kenya on-lent the proceeds of the BCL (captured via captured via Project ID#37103) and the PBC (captured via Project ID#31777) to the ‘end-user’ (KRC). The ultimate borrower (KRC) was expected to use the proceeds of the BCL and PBC to to finance 90% of the total costs of the two commercial contracts that it signed with CRBC on July 11, 2012 and October 4, 2012. More specifically, the proceeds from the PBC were to be used to finance 42.06% of the total costs of the two commercial contracts and be exclusively utilized to make payment for the ‘Line Section of the Project’ (i.e. the construction contents and items under the Construction on the Civil Works of Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project EPC Turnkey Commercial Contract). The proceeds from the BCL were to be used to finance (a) 31.95% of the total cost ($849,000,000 out of $2,657,401,776.17) of the ‘Line Section of the Project’ (i.e. the construction contents and items under the Construction on the Civil Works of Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project EPC Turnkey Commercial Contract), (b) 85% of the total cost ($974,772,357.44 out of $1,146,791,008.75) of the Supply and Installation of the Facilities, Locomotives and Rolling Stocks for the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project Contract, and (c) 85% of the total cost ($179,811,671,43 out of $211,543,142.85) of the medium-long term buyer’s credit insurance premium from Sinosure. The remaining 10% was to be paid by Kenya Railways Corporation to China Road and Bridge Corporation as counterpart financing, of which not less than $380,420,427.8 was to be applied to the Facilities, Locomotives and Rolling Stocks for the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project Contract. In order to facilitate repayment of its debts to China Eximbank, the Kenyan Government provided an assurance to the lender that it would guarantee a minimum amount of railway freight through the execution of a take-or-pay agreement between KRC and the Kenya Ports Authority (KPA). The KPA also agreed to levy a new, 1.5% tax on imported goods (called the ‘Railway Development Levy’). The Railway Development Levy was designed to serve as insurance in case the revenues generated through the take-or-pay arrangement fall short of the amount required to service the China Eximbank loans. The borrower also expected to use to the Railway Development Levy to finance the Kenyan government’s portion (15%) of the project (commercial contract) cost.    The BCL and PBC are secured by (i.e. collateralized against) project revenues that are deposited into a revenue account (escrow account) and a minimum cash balance in a payment account (escrow account). A 2014 Escrow Account Agreement between Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC), the Government of Kenya, and China Eximbank specifies that ‘KRC shall ensure that the following minimum amounts in [U.S.] Dollars [USD] shall be held in the Payment Account, so long as an Secured Obligations under the Loan [PBC and BCL] Agreement remain outstanding: (i) when the Loans are within the applicable Grace Period, no less than US$84,000,000, which shall be deposited into the Payment Account in the following installments: 1) an amount, of US$16,800,000, shall be deposited into the Payment Account before the first disbursement, 2) an amount of US$16,800,000 shall be deposited into the Payment Account before January 15, 2015, 3) an amount of US$25,200,000 shall be deposited into the Payment Account before July 15, 2015, 4) an amount of US$25,200,000 shall be deposited into the Payment Account before July 15, 2016; (ii) when any Loan [PBC or BCL] is within its Repayment Period, no less than US$250,000,000, and (iii) when the [BCL is] fully repaid, no less than US$80,000,000.' If the borrower does not adhere to its loan repayment schedule (runs arrears), the escrow account bank is responsible for withdrawing funds the overdue payment amount (plus 1% penalty interest) from the payment account and remitting payment to China Eximbank; then, the escrow account bank reimburses/replenishes the payment account with funds from the revenue account (where project revenues are deposited).

Given that the BCL was still in its grace period until August 11, 2019 and the Preferential Buyer’s Credit (PBC) was still in its grace period until August 11, 2021, the borrower evidently complied with the lender’s requirement that it maintain a USD 84 million cash balance in the USD escrow account while the BCL and PBC were still in their grace periods and the lender’s requirement that it maintain a USD 250 million cash balance in the USD escrow account while either loan was in its repayment period (as specified in the Escrow Account Agreement).  The borrower made principal repayments on the BCL worth $100,179,201.44 between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and $200,358,402.88 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022). The BCL’s amount outstanding was $1,903,404,827.42 as of June 30, 2020, $1,703,046,424.53 as of June 30, 2021, and $1,502,688,021.64 as of June 30, 2022.   The borrower made no principal repayments on the PBC between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021 (Fiscal Year 2020-2021) and principal repayments worth $61,538,461.54 between July 1, 2021 and June 30, 2022 (Fiscal Year 2021-2022). The PBC’s amount outstanding was $1,600,000,000 as of June 30, 2020, $1,600,000,000 as of June 30, 2021, and $1,538,461,538.46 as of June 30, 2022.  The Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) is the largest infrastructure project constructed in Kenya since independence in 1963. The Kenyan Government and the Ugandan Government first promoted the idea of the SGR in 2008 as part of a Northern Corridor Initiative to link the Kenyan coastal city of Mombasa to the landlocked countries of the Great Lakes Region. In August 2009, Kenya’s Ministry of Transport (MoT) and CRBC signed a memorandum of understanding, whereby CRBC agreed to undertake a feasibility study of the SGR Project at no cost to Kenya’s MoT.     In January 2011, CRBC submitted a feasibility report to Kenya’s MoT, which concluded that Phase 1 of the railway’s expected economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was of 14.66%, which was higher than the Government of Kenya’s ‘hurdle rate’ of 12%. However, the CRBC feasibility study later became a source of controversy. Its central conclusion — that the SGR was economically feasible — was inconsistent with the conclusions of previous studies undertaken by the World Bank and a Canadian consultancy firm. The CRBC feasibility study also included no cash flow projections. It asserted that the project would be highly profitable, but its estimates of the net present value (NPV) of the project’s expected economic benefits varied between $2 billion and $2.6 billion. The fact that the project’s estimated economic benefits were lower than its expected costs aroused suspicion about the credibility of the 14.66% EIRR estimate. The Government of Kenya’s decision to only allow CRBC to conduct the project’s feasibility study was also challenged by the Law Society of Kenya (LSK), which argued that Kenyan laws require competitive bidding for a feasibility study. However, a Kenyan court ruled in favor of the government, and stated that the whole procurement process was legal. After the award of tender for the whole project was issued without competitive bidding, sub-tenders did not follow competitive bidding processes. Two Kenyan parliamentary committees, learning of this lack of competitive bidding, recommended cancellation of the sub-tenders, but they were ignored by President Kenyatta. Then, in 2020, a Kenyan court of appeal ruled that the SGR contract issued to CRBC was illegal because it was issued in a manner that is inconsistent Kenya’s procurement laws. The court ruled that the contract should be made public, but a Kenyan MoT official said that making the contract public would undermine national security.     The purpose of the project was to construct a 485 km railway from the Kenyan port of Mombasa to Nairobi and then onward to Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and South Sudan. Upon completion, the railway was expected have a total track length of 609 km. The project sought to transport passengers and cargo from Nairobi to the southeastern port city of Mombasa at 120 kilometers per hour, thus reducing travel time between Nairobi and Mombasa from more than 10 hours to more than 4 hours. The project was also expected to reduce travel times and transport costs by as much as 60 percent. If properly implemented, the Kenyan Government estimated that the railway would increase the country’s annual rate of economic growth by 1.5 percentage points.   China Road & Bridge Corporation (CRBC) was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation, and Kenya Railway Corporation (KR) supervised its work. Project implementation commenced on December 12, 2014. The project reached completion on May 31, 2017, eighteen months ahead of schedule. President Kenyatta scheduled the completion ceremony just two months before voters would go to the polls and on Madaraka Day—a national holiday that commemorates the day when colonial Britain granted Kenya the right to internal self-rule. At the project completion ceremony, President Kenyatta gave a speech and said that ‘[our] history … was first started 122 years ago when the British, who had colonised this nation, kicked off the train to nowhere ... it was then dubbed the ‘Lunatic Express’. Today... despite again a lot of criticism we now celebrate not the ‘Lunatic Express’ but the Madaraka Express that will begin to reshape the story of Kenya for the next 100 years.’ However, the project has become a source of local scrutiny and controversy. In December 2018, a letter from Kenya’s Auditor General to the Kenya Ports Authority was leaked to the media. It suggested that the Port of Mombasa’s assets were sources of collateral that could be seized in the event that the Kenyan government could not repay its loans to China Eximbank. The letter also suggested that the Kenyan government had waived its sovereign immunity rights in order to make this pledge of collateral. The possibility that Beijing would seize a strategic asset like the Port of Mombasa provokes a public outcry in Kenya. President Kenyatta dismissed the criticism that the Kenyan government had mortgaged the Port of Mombasa to Beijing as ‘pure propaganda.’ He told a group of journalists that ‘if you want a copy of the [SGR loan] contract we have with China I can get it to you tomorrow. […]’. But neither the BCL contract nor the PBC contract was made public. In 2018, the SGR project also became a target of an anti-corruption drive by Kenya's Department of Public Prosecutions (DPP). According to Reuters, the “Kenyan authorities […] arrested the head of the agency that manages public land and the boss of the state railway on suspicion of corruption over land allocation for the new $3-billion flagship Nairobi-Mombasa railway. […] Mohammed Abdalla Swazuri, the chairman of National Land Commission, was one of 18 officials, businesspeople and companies named in a statement listing arrests that was posted …on the prosecutor’s office’s Twitter feed. Also arrested was Atanas Kariuki Maina, managing director of the Kenya Railways Corporation. […] The investigation that led to the arrests centers on allegations that officials siphoned taxpayer money through [fraudulent] compensation claims for land used for the railway.’    John Githongo, a former anti-corruption czar in Kenya, told a newspaper in August 2022 that ‘[t]he standard gauge railway is the jewel in the crown of corruption in Kenya.’ The secrecy surrounding the China Eximbank loan contracts that were issued for the SGR Project has also become a source of local concern. The Kenyan government has declined to make public the loan contracts in response to a court petition by two activists (Khelef Khalifa and Wanjiru Gikonyo), saying they have non-disclosure clauses and that releasing them would amount to breaching a bilateral agreement, thereby impairing relations between the Kenyan government and the Chinese Government. According to an affidavit from Kenya’s Public Works Principal Secretary Solomon Kitungu, releasing the loan contracts would undermine Kenya’s national security ‘since [the] terms in the contract[s] touch on foreign government information with implications on national security and foreign relations.’ Two activists—Khelef Khalifa and Wanjiru Gikonyo—filed a petition in 2021 at the High Court in Mombasa seeking to obtain all contracts, agreements, and studies for the construction and operation of the SGR. Through a coalition called Okoa Mombasa, Khalifa had previously attempted and failed to get the documents through Kenya’s Access to Information Act after the Kenyan government directed that all containerized cargo at the Port of Mombasa be transported inland through the SGR. This move reportedly had negative impact on the Kenyan coast’s port-based economy because it forced logistics companies to move their operations to container depots in the country’s interior. ‘We have a right to know the details of the project: how our money is being spent, the consequences of a loan default, and the government’s decision-making processes in signing the deal. Right now, we know none of this—the Kenyan public is completely in the dark,’ said Khalifa. Gikonyo, his co-petitioner, is the national coordinator for The Institute for Social Accountability, a Nairobi-based civil society organization.    Yet another concern about the project is related to its revenue performance. It was originally projected that the railway would move 22 million tons of cargo a year. However, a Government of Kenya assessment later revealed that the maximum amount of cargo that the railway could move was approximately 8.7 million tons of cargo a year. Also, one year after the SGR was put into operation, a parliamentary report showed that it cost more than double the amount to transport goods on the train than on the road. To make the railway profitable, the Kenyan authorities compelled importers to send cargo by railway instead of by road. This decision set off protests, riots, and court cases in October 2019 and November 2019. Then, on On December 4, 2019. Kenya’s senate committee on transport summoned the Kenyan cabinet secretary for transport over his directive to haul cargo from the port city of Mombasa to Nairobi exclusively by rail. The meeting — attended by activists, businessmen and leaders from Mombasa — ended with the cabinet secretary, James Macharia, promising to rescind the directive, which had reportedly hurt local businesses. Then, in September 2020  Kenyan lawmakers tabled a report in parliament recommending that the government renegotiate the terms of the China Eximbank loans for the SGR ‘due to the prevailing economic distress occasioned by the effects of Covid 19’. In the same report, the lawmakers recommend that the government renegotiate the SGR operation agreement, ‘by planning to reduce operation costs by at least 50%’. The SGR operators had to halt its passenger service for nearly three months due to concerns about the potential spread of the pandemic. CRBC operates the railway’s passenger and cargo service through its subsidiary, the Africa Star Railway Operation Company. In the three years the SGR has been in operation, Africa Star Railway Operation’s expenditure has always exceeded revenue, and the Kenyan taxpayer money has to fill the gap to sustain the company’s operations. A report by Kenya’s transport ministry tabled in parliament in 2018 says the railway made a loss of KES 9.8 billion ($90.3 million) in its first year of operation. At the time, the Kenyan Government projected a profit of $46.8 million for the following year. However, a report by the transport ministry in 2020, also tabled to parliament, said the railway recorded a loss of $200 million over the previous three years. The document also said that during this period, the railway generated revenues of $230.7 million but had operational costs of $430.5 million. The transport ministry cited reduced limited storage capacity at a Nairobi container depot, minimum use of the city’s freight terminal, and railway charges as reasons for this performance, arguably the kinds of details a thorough appraisal should have raised. The SGR operates both passenger and cargo services and while passengers embrace it for reducing travel time compared to buses, cargo owners shun it for reasons including higher fees and tariffs, additional time clearing goods and a lack of last-mile delivery, when compared to trucks. Kenya’s election in August 2022 became a vote on President Uhuru Kenyatta’s legacy of debt-financed infrastructure building, much of it built and financed by China Eximbank. This was especially true for the SGR.    The opposition party candidate Raila Odinga ran on a promise to renegotiate the Kenyan government’s outstanding debts to China Eximbank. Speaking at Chatham House in London on March 16, 2022, he said he would assemble a tough team of negotiators: ‘It depends on how you negotiate with the Chinese. If you don't have negotiators they will of course impose their terms on you.’ Several months later, in June 2022, the ruling party presidential candidate, William Ruto, told Reuters that he would publish government contracts with Chinese companies and renegotiate loans with China Eximbank. Then, in September 2022, newly elected Kenyan President William Ruto reverted cargo clearing services from Nairobi inland container depot (ICD) to the Port of Mombasa. The expected immediate impact of reverting port operations to the Port of Mombasa was a shift to road haulage and a reduction in cargo business for the SGR. Ruto’s predecessor, Uhuru Kenyatta, moved cargo clearance to the Nairobi ICD to help ease congestion at the Port of Mombasa and boost its competitiveness while also boosting traffic on the SGR to increase revenue for debt repayment. The effect of Ruto’s September 2022 decision was to shift more of the responsibility for repayment of the China Eximbank loans to Kenyan taxpayers.  In mid-October 2022, Kenya’s incoming Transport Secretary, Kipchumba Murkomen also said during his confirmation hearing that he planned to renegotiate the China Eximbank loans for the Standard Gauge Railway Project. He said that these loans were likely repayable over fifty years rather than fifteen to twenty years. He also said that ‘[I]f approved, I will look for the SGR agreement and make it available to the public because no one knows the contents of that agreement’. Then, in November 2022, Kipchumba Murkomen publicly disclosed all three China Eximbank loan agreements for the SGR project.  There are some indications that the SGR loans have underperformed vis-a-vis the lender's original expectations. In July 2022, the Government of Kenya received 'settlement notes' (an overdue repayment notification) from China Eximbank. Then, in October 2022, local media outlets reported (based on confidential Treasury documents) that the Government of Kenya defaulted on its China Eximbank loans for Phase 1 of the Standard Gauge Railway Project. The lender reportedly imposed a fine (‘default interest’ payment) worth $10.8 million (1.312 billion Kenyan shillings).","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Recipient State-owned Company",2107250407.87657,"This 475 km railway runs from Mombasa to Nairobi.

JSC KazTransGas (KTG) and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) (acting through Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited) each hold a 50% ownership stake in BSGP. The Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline is a 1,454 km long gas pipeline that runs through the Mangistau, Aktyubinsk, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions. It has a pipe diameter of 1067 mm. The purpose of the project was to ensure stable gas demand in the southern Kazakhstan, reduce dependence on imported gas and ensure the energy security of Kazakhstan. Construction of the pipeline was split into two phases. The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved the construction of 1,143.2 km of pipeline from the Bozoi gas metering station in the Shalkar region of Aktobe Region to Akbulak gas metering station in Sairam of South Kazakhstan Region (now known as the Turkistan Region). It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-1 and Bozoy shift camp in Shalkar region of Aktobe Region, emergency-response centers in Saksaulsk, Aksuat and Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region and an emergency-response center in Shornak within the South Kazakhstan Region, as well as construction of the automated process control system (SCADA) and telecommunication (fiber-optic communication line) for the gas pipeline in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions.   The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project commenced on July 17, 2012. The project was originally expected to be completed by the end of 2012. It was ultimately completed on September 7, 2013, resulting in a throughput capacity of up to 10 bcm per year. The second phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved 306.3 km of gas pipeline construction from Beineu settlement in the Mangystau Region to Bozoi settlement in the Aktobe Region. It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-4 Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region, Beineu gas metering station in Mangystau Region, the SCADA central dispatch control in Kyzylorda, and gas pipeline construction in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions. It was completed on December 30, 2016. Between 2014 and 2017, over 9.0 bcm of gas was transported via the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent gas pipeline, providing the southern regions with Kazakhstani gas. Then, in November 2017, a head compressor station at Bozoi and a line compressor station at Karaozek were put into operation, increasing the capacity of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline to 10 bcm per year. In October 2017, Kazakhstan began exporting gas to China pursuant to a contract concluded between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina for the supply of bcm from October 15, 2017 until October 14, 2018. The price of the gas exported to China pursuant to this agreement was linked to the price of Brent crude oil and determined quarterly. As of December 31, 2017, negotiations were ongoing with respect to a long-term gas supply agreement between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina. BSGP and KazMunayGas expected that the export of gas to China would increase in the future and made plans to construct three new compressor stations on the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline between 2018 and 2019 to handle increased throughput.   In order to fund Phase I of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $1.8 billion USD syndicated loan with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BoC) on December 11, 2012 (captured via Project ID#39562). This loan bore interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 2.7% margin per annum for the duration of the guarantee period (until December 31, 2019) and, thereafter, at a rate of 3-month LIBOR plus a 3.2% margin per annum. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in December 2017 until March 11, 2028 (implying a grace period of 5 years and a maturity period of 15.25 years). The loan was secured by corporate guarantees from KazMunayGas and CNPC. In February 2016 and September 2017, amendments were signed because of BSGP's non-compliance with certain project milestones provided for in the facility (loan) agreement; the milestones were extended until September 30, 2019. These amendments required BSGP's prepayment of $400 million of the outstanding indebtedness, which KazMunayGas provided to BSGP for repayment. The loan was secured by additional security, including an offshore account charge, an onshore account pledge and security assignment of BSGP's rights under the shareholder support agreement in favor of the security agent. As of June 30, 2017, the loan’s outstanding amount was $1.462 billion USD. As of December 31, 2017, the loan’s outstanding amount was was $1.0 billion USD.   Then, on September 17, 2015, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $700 million USD syndicated loan agreement with CDB and BOC for Phase II of the project to supplement their $1.8 billion USD loan for Phase I. CDB and BoC each contributed $350 million USD to the loan for Phase II. Project ID#73384 captures the BoC contribution. Project ID#40362 captures the CDB contribution. The $700 million loan for Phase II carried a maturity of 15 years (final maturity date: September 17, 2030). Its interest rate is unknown. Then, on August 14, 2019, Beinenu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $720 million syndicated facility (loan) agreement with Bank of China and MUFG Bank, Ltd. (captured via Project #91744). The proceeds of the syndicated loan were to be used by the borrower to refinance the $1.8 billion CDB/BoC loan that it contracted on December 11, 2012. The interest rate of the August 2019 syndicated loan (3-month LIBOR plus a 1.65% margin) was lower than the interest rate of the December 2012 loan. The maturity length of the August 2019 syndicated loan (5.33 years; final maturity date: December 20, 2024) was also shorter than the maturity length of the December 2012 loan. As as result of this debt refinancing arrangement, Beinenu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP reduced its repayment obligations for Phase I by $10.5 million.","Completion","Commercial","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Commercial Bank|State-owned Policy Bank","Other Joint Venture/Special Purpose Vehicle",2113422404.26652,"The Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline is a 1,454 km long gas pipeline that runs through the Mangistau, Aktyubinsk, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions.

As of May 2022, the loan had achieved an 88.3% disbursement rate ($1,855,660,000 out of $2,099,965,834). The loan's (principal) amount outstanding was $504,821,918.39 as of December 31, 2015, $1,230,795,697.28 as of December 31, 2017, $1,478,957,102.66 as of December 31, 2019 and $1,376,381,351.22 as of December 31, 2020.   The purpose of the project is to replace 1593 km of track along the Belgrano Freight Railway, which stretches from Retiro station in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires through a total of 14 Argentine provinces: Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, Córdoba, San Luis, Mendoza, San Juan, La Rioja, Catamarca, Tucumán, Santiago del Estero, Chaco, Formosa, Salta, and Jujuy. The rail network even connects with two neighboring countries: one of its branches links with Chile through the Socompa border crossing in Salta province, continuing to the port of Antofagasta on the Pacific. There are two alternative connections with Bolivia, neither of which are currently operating. The first is through La Quiaca in Jujuy province, the second through Salvador Mazza in Salta province. The project also involves the acquisition of 1000 wagons and 30 locomotives. This project will be implemented as part of the Argentine government’s Belgrano Plan, which is a set of transportation, infrastructure, production, health, employment, housing, and education policies and programs that target the country's northern provinces.  The rail replacement works is scheduled to take place in three phases. Work on the first phase will cover 535 km and it includes the Santurce-Tostado-Chorotis-Las Breñas section, the Pampa del Infierno-Los Frentones section, and the Los Pirpintos-Los Tigres-Taco Pozo sections in Santa Fe, Chaco, and Santiago del Estero provinces. Work on the second phase is 500 km in length and it includes the Coronda-Santo Tomé and Laguna Paiva-Naré sections, both in Santa Fe province, and Talavera-Pichanal-Embarcación-Chalicán, between Salta and Jujuy. The third phase of the project is 558 km in length and it includes refurbishment of the Tucumán-Metán-Joaquín V. González and Metán-Chalicán sections in Tucumán, Salta, and Jujuy provinces. These activities are expected to generate 23,000 jobs, including both direct and indirect employment. The project implies major logistical work, including the transportation of more than 2 million sleepers, 170,000 tons of rail, and 5 million tons of ballast stone.   CMEC is the general EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. However, China South Locomotive & Rolling Stock Corporation (CSR) and CRRC Qishuyan —a subsidiary of the CRRC Corporation Limited —are also involved in the project as subcontractors.   An official project commencement ceremony took place on July 18, 2014. However, construction activities did not begin until December 2014. The project was originally expected to reach completion within two years (December 2016). CMEC had delivered 107 locomotives and 2500 carriages by February 2017.  Then, in January 2018, locomotives manufactured by China's CRRC Qishuyan, arrived in Argentina. On May 31, 2019, President Macri attended the inauguration ceremony of the first 700 km of renewed railway tracks of the Belgrano Cargas train in the town of Joaquin V. Gonzalez in Salta province. As of May 2022, the project had achieved a 77.96% completion rate.   The Belgrano Cargas Railway Line Rehabilitation Project was at risk of cancellation and loan default in 2016. On July 18, 2014, Argentina’s Ministry of Economy and Public Finance signed a $4,714,350,000 syndicated term loan facility agreement with three Chinese state-owned banks (Bank of China, China Development Bank, and ICBC) for the construction of two hydroelectric dams (the so-called Kirchner-Cepernic dams) on the Santa Cruz River in Patagonia. The loan agreement included a cross-default clause, stating that if the borrower canceled the project, CDB financing for a separate project (the $2,099,965,834 loan for the Belgrano Cargas Railway Line Project) would also be cancelled. In November 2015, newly elected Argentine President Mauricio Macri announced his intention to suspend the construction of the Kirchner-Cepernic dams. These dams are located on the Santa Cruz River near the famous Perito Moreno Glacier (UNESCO World Heritage Site) that feeds from the same river, and the Macri administration considered these dams to be too risky on environmental grounds. When President Macri first announced his intention to suspend the project, CDB, ICBC, and Bank of China had already disbursed $950 million under the syndicated term loan agreement.   Then, on March 10, 2016, CDB sent a warning letter to Argentina's Finance Minister, Alfonso Prat Gay, The letter said: ""The Kirchner-Cepernic dams and the Belgrano Cargas are major projects promoted by the Chinese Communist Party and signed during the same political time period in Argentina and each one of the ... facility agreements contain cross-default clauses."" The Macri administration subsequently reversed course and announced that it no longer intended to suspend construction of the Nestor Kirchner and Jorge Cepernic Hydroelectric Dams.  On January 19, 2022, an MOU was signed between the Ministry of Transport, the Administración de Infraestructuras Ferroviarias Sociedad del Estado, and China Railway International Group Co., Ltd. regarding cooperation in railway matters. This was signed so as to carry out the Modernization and Electrification Project of the Belgrano Norte Railway.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company",2230794644.95362,"The Belgrano Freight Railway stretches from Retiro station in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires through a total of 14 Argentine provinces: Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, Córdoba, San Luis, Mendoza, San Juan, La Rioja, Catamarca, Tucumán, Santiago del Estero, Chaco, Formosa, Salta, and Jujuy.

The loan carried the following borrowing terms: an annual interest rate of 6.9%, a default (penalty) interest rate of 1.5%, a grace period of 5.5 years, a maturity of 15 years, a 0.4% commitment fee, and a 0.4% management fee. The loan agreement required that the borrower purchase buyer’s credit insurance from Sinosure.   The proceeds of the loan were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of the $1,979,700,000 EPC contract between Coca Codo Sinclair E.P. and Sinohydro Corporation, which was signed on October 5, 2009.

The Coca Codo Sinclair hydroelectric project was first proposed in the early 1980s but could not be implemented because of the Reventador volcanic eruption in 1987 and financial constraints. Then, in 2007, Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa restarted the project and Italian company Electroconsult was contracted to conduct a new feasibility study. In February 2008, Coca Codo Sinclair SA was established as a joint venture company between Ecuador’s state-owned power company Termopichincha (70% ownership stake) and Energia Argentina (30% ownership stake). The Government of Ecuador then bought the entire 30% ownership stake of Energia Argentina for $5.5 million in September 2009. Coca Codo Sinclair E.P. — a project company (special purpose vehicle) — was eventually established to oversee the design and implementation of the Coca Codo Sinclair Hydroelectric Project. Its sole shareholder is La Corporación Eléctrica del Ecuador E.P. (CELEC), an Ecuadorian state-owned holding company engaged in electricity generation, transmission, distribution, and commercialization.   The purpose of the project was to construct a 1500 MW hydroelectric power plant in El Reventador on the Coca River between the provinces of Napo and Sucumbíos. The plant’s eight turbines were designed to produce 8.8 billion kWh per annum, supplying 35% of the country’s overall electricity consumption and saving about two billion liters of imported diesel for thermal power plants per year. The project was developed in an area where the Coca River flows in a great curve at a natural slope of 620 meters. The water intake complex is located on the Coca River, 1 km downstream of the confluence of the Quijos and Salado rivers. It comprises a concrete face rockfill dam built on the existing river channel, a concrete spillway built on the left bank of the river, and the sedimentation basin and intake built between the dam and spillway. Any water diverted from the intake passes via the 120 meter-long sedimentation basin to run through a 24.8 km-long concrete-lined headrace tunnel, with an excavation diameter of 9.1 meters, into the compensating reservoir, which has a usable volume 800,000m³. Water from the compensating reservoir is fed through two 1,900 meter-long penstocks to the eight Pelton turbines installed in the underground powerhouse, which measure 26m x 50m x 192m. A parallel cavern of 16.5m x 33m x 192m houses 24 single-phase transformers of 68.3 MVA each and a 500kV substation. The access path to the powerhouse is 495m long, 6.5m wide and 7.5m high. A tailrace tunnel delivers water back to the Coca River. The hydroelectric project is designed to use a 620 meter-high natural waterfall with a maximum regulated flow of water of 278m³/s. Coca Codo’s run-of-river intake has a maximum capacity of 7,500m³/s. The sedimentation basin has six bays and a design sediment particles size of 0.25mm, while the maximum derived flow in the headrace tunnel is 222m³/s. Two penstocks with vertical shaft and horizontal reach feed the water from the compensating reservoir to the eight generating units of the plant. In addition, the power plant is equipped with eight six-nozzle vertical Pelton turbines, each with a rated output of 187.7MW. Each turbine is powered by a runner with 22 buckets with a width of 835mm.   Sinohydro was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation and its work was overseen by Coca Codo Sinclair E.P. and CELEC. Project implementation commenced on July 28, 2010. The access road to the powerhouse was completed in October 2012. A tunnel collapse at the plant construction site killed 13 people and injured 12 in December 2014. It also caused partial damage to the high-pressure pipes inside the engine room. The project was ultimately completed on November 18, 2016. Its originally scheduled completion date was January 28, 2016.   Since then, the project has been plagued by a variety of engineering problems and corruption accusations.  In 2017, the Ecuadorian tax authority (SRI) uncovered pending taxes of $198 million from Sinohydro. One of the main controversies involved a payment of $172.5 million by Sinhohydro to China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) for the purchase of an insurance policy, for which Sinohydro sought tax deductions, which SRI rejected. Then, in December 2018, the New York Times reported that ‘7,648 cracks have developed in the dam’s machinery, according to the government, because of substandard steel and inadequate welding by Sinohydro. Sand and silt are also big concerns because they can damage vital equipment.’  In May 2021, CELEC requested arbitration through the International Chamber of Commerce to settle a dispute over cracks in the power plant’s machinery that prevented it from operating at full capacity since it was completed in 2016 (after $2.2 billion in construction costs). Then, in July 2021, Reuters reported that new problems at the hydroelectric plant threatened water flow and electricity generation. During a shutdown of four of the facility’s eight turbines for planned maintenance, CELEC discovered missing bolts on some of its valves. CELEC CEO Gonzalo Uquillas said that the problem could prevent valves from opening and closing to adequately regulate the flow of water. ‘Of the 96 bolts that secure the seals on these valves, some bolts are missing,’ Uquillas said in an interview on July 16, 2021. He added that ‘I don’t want to believe they weren’t installed, but they are missing.’ Then, in March 2023, Ecuador's Prosecutor General filed charges against 37 people, including the former President of Ecuador Lenín Moreno (2017-2021) and five former employees of Sinohydro (Cai Runguo, Yan Huijun, Song Dongsheng, Wu Yu, and Liu Aisheg) for allegedly accepting bribes worth $1.1 million to secure the commercial contract for the 1500MW Coca Codo Sinclair Hydroelectric Facility Project.  The China Eximbank loan (BCL) that supported the Coca Codo Sinclair Hydroelectric Project has also financially underperformed. It was rescheduled twice — once in September 2020 (as captured via Project ID#93431) and again in September 2022 (as captured via Project ID#96292).","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Recipient Joint Venture/Special Purpose Vehicle|Chinese State-owned Company",2343604287.57644,"The Coca Codo Sinclair Dam is a hydroelectric dam in Ecuador.

On February 22, 2011, the Development Bank of Kazakhstan JSC (DBK) entered into a $1.4 billion credit agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China to finance the construction of an integrated petrochemical project in the Atyrau Region of Kazakstan. However, as of 2017, no amounts had been drawn down under this credit agreement. This was due to the mutual termination of the EPC contract between KPI and Sinopec in 2014. Therefore, AidData assumes that the China Eximbank loan was canceled (since the proceeds of this loan were to be used to fund the EPC contract with Sinopec). The loan cancellation is captured via Project ID#40266.

Then, in November 2015, China Development Bank (CDB) and signed a Financing Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for this project.   Then, in September 2016, five Chinese state-owned banks and VTEC signed a $2 billion syndicated loan agreement for the 1980MW Vinh Tan 3 Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project. Chinese members of the syndicate included China Development Bank (CDB), China Construction Bank (CCB), Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), Bank of China (BoC) and Bank of Communications (BoComm). CDB was the mandated lead arranger and Sinosure provided export buyer’s credit insurance. The borrowing terms of the non-recourse loan are unknown.   The borrower used the proceeds from the syndicated loan to partially finance an EPC contract signed on June 23, 2015 with Harbin Electric International Company. The purpose of the project was to construct a 1980MW coal-fired power plant — with three power generation units (Unit 1, Unit 2, and Unit 3) — in Vĩnh Tân commune, Tuy Phong district, and Bình Thuận province.   In December 2019, CLP announced that it would no longer invest in new coal-fired power plants, thereby raising questions about the financial viability of the 1980MW Vinh Tan 3 Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project. Then, in January 2020, HSBC announced that it would join Standard Chartered Bank and not participate in the syndicated loan supporting the 1980MW Vinh Tan 3 Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project. It did so on environmental grounds. Then, in February 2021, Mitsubishi Corporation announced that it was withdrawing from the project, which was reportedly the first time it had ever withdrawn from a coal-fired plant project.   As of September 2020, the 1980MW Vinh Tan 3 Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project had still not entered the construction stage and the power plant was expected to be operational in 2024.","Pipeline: Commitment","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Commercial Bank|State-owned Commercial Bank|State-owned Commercial Bank|State-owned Policy Bank|State-owned Commercial Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Other Joint Venture/Special Purpose Vehicle",2361609016.71693,"The purpose of the project was to construct a 1980MW coal-fired power plant  — with three power generation units (Unit 1, Unit 2, and Unit 3 ) —in Vĩnh Tân commune, Tuy Phong district, and Bình Thuận province (exact locational coordinates: 11.32082, 108.80630).

The agreement is a master agreement under which the Government of Angola and CDB may conclude individual loan agreements (ILAs) for the purpose of financing up to 85% of the contract price owing to certain approved contractors in respect of certain approved infrastructure projects in Angola, primarily in the areas of housing, transportation, agriculture, roads and railways, hospitals, schools, telecommunication, water and electricity, sanitation and other human livelihood areas agreed by CDB and Angola. Each individual (subsidiary) loan approved through the facility must be for a minimum of $10 million and have a maturity of 10 years.   As of December 31, 2017, $2,199,500,000 was drawn down under the MLFA. The (principal) amount outstanding under the MLFA was $300.5 million as of December 31, 2017 and $2.1 billion as of December 31, 2021. The availability period for drawdowns under this master facility agreement ended on May 9, 2017. However, it was later extended until 2021.   Projects that may have been funded through the master facility agreement include: 1. Construction of access roads to Luanda International Airport (Project ID#65307) 2. Rehabilitation of New Luanda International Airport (Project ID#72349)  There are indications that the May 2014 CDB loan financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In December 2020, CDB and the Government of Angola entered into an agreement to reprofile multiple loan agreements that they had previously signed, including the $15 billion loan agreement from December 2015. The December 2020 agreement included (i) a three-year deferral of principal payments; and (ii) repayment of deferred principal falling due in 2020H2–2023H1 over seven years after the grace period, with some additional modest relief of principal in 2024–25. The Government of Angola also agreed to use the outstanding cash balance in an escrow account — known as the Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) — to make interest payments to the CDB between 2020 to 2022, which it expected would bring the DSRA balance to nearly zero by mid-2022. However, under the terms of the debt reprofiling agreement, the parties agreed that the borrower would need to replenish the DSRA to approximately $1.5 billion (the minimum cash balance previously agreed upon by the lender and borrower) by 2023.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","OTHER MULTISECTOR","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank",NA,2435055961.48297,"More detailed locational information can be found at https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/195543465#map=14/-9.0537/13.4970, https://www.openstreetmap.org/directions?engine=fossgis_osrm_car&route=-8.8271%2C13.2443%3B-9.0153%2C13.5413, https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/540228867","Low income","Precise","Yes"

China Eximbank agreed to cover 82% of the total project cost, with the Government of Pakistan covering the remaining 18%. This 'mixed credit' arrangement produced four different financial commitments: two preferential buyer's credits (PBC), one government concessional loan (GCL), and one buyer's credit loan (BCL). On January 14, 2014, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed a $382,848,800 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2013) 50 TOTAL NO. (294)]. Its borrowing terms are unknown (captured via Project ID#92413).

(360) and Government of Pakistan loan ID# PBC-2015-18-360] for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 8 year grace period (captured via Project ID#41918). This agreement was amended on October 8, 2019 [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (15) 18 TOTAL NO. (360) (A)], but the purpose of the amendment is unknown. Additionally, on December 18, 2015, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed a $2.25 billion buyer’s credit loan (BCL) [Government of Pakistan loan ID#BC-BLA201401 and BCL 2015212932] carrying a 6% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 8 year grace period (captured via Project ID#41917).  The Government of Pakistan on-lent some or all of the proceeds of the China Eximbank loans to Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) -- a federally funded independent governmental agency -- at a 15% interest rate. The Government of Pakistan also reportedly issued sovereign guarantees for all four China Eximbank loans that supported the project. In December 2015, the amounts outstanding under all four China Eximbank loans (worth $5.668 billion) were reportedly transferred by the Government of Pakistan to PAEC (as the direct borrower).   The purpose of the project was to construct units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP), which is located in Paradise Point in Karachi within Sindh Province.  China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. It is using Hualon One technology (the CNNC's third-generation nuclear reactor design) to construct Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on November 26, 2013. Then, a major milestone was reached at the K-2 reactor when so-called ‘cold functional tests’ began on November 26, 2019. Cold functional tests are carried out to confirm whether the main system and its supporting facilities are properly installed and ready to operate under high-pressure conditions. K-2 was ultimately connected to the national grid on March 18, 2021. It was officially inaugurated on May 21, 2021 and put into operation on May 24, 2021. The K-3 reactor came online on March 4, 2022. The project was originally expected to reach completion by the end of 2020.  There are some indications that the $2.250 billion China Eximbank buyer's credit loan for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In May 2019, PAEC sought the Prime Minister's approval to have the interest rates of the China Eximbank loans for Units 2 and 3 of the KANUPP Project reset to their original levels (when they were first issued by China Eximbank). Local sources reported at the time that the electricity tariff determined by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) was set on the basis of actual electricity generation costs and on-lending at a 15% rate increased actual electricity generation costs by PKR 108 billion (necessitating an PKR 1.8/kWh increase in the tariff rate). However, it is unclear if the Prime Minister approved PAEC’s request. Then, on or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the $2.250 billion buyer's credit loan agreement for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. Then, on November 19, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE1-031]. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between January 1, 2021 and June 30, 2021 under the $2.250 billion buyer's credit loan agreement for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. Then, on or around July 1, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2021 and December 31, 2021 under the  $2.250 billion buyer's credit loan agreement for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. Then, in April 2022, local media reported that the operation of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant and the repayment of the China Eximbank loans that supported its construction had become a challenge due the absence of requisite payments from the Government of Pakistan's Central Power Purchasing Agency–Guaranteed (CPPA-G).

The loan carried the following terms: a 5-year maturity and an annual interest rate of EURIBOR (-0.134% in March 2016) plus a 3.5% margin.   The project involved the construction of a 3,000 kilometer gas pipeline that traverse the Irkutsk and Amur Regions and the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The pipeline route passes through swampy, mountainous, seismically active, permafrost and rocky areas with extreme environmental conditions. The absolute lowest air temperatures along the Power of Siberia route range from –41 degrees Celsius in the Amur Region to –62 degrees Celsius in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). The project was implemented in three phases (or sections): the first phase (section) of pipeline construction ran some 2,200 kilometers from the Chayandinskoye field (Yakutia) to Blagoveshchensk (Chinese border); the second phase (section) of pipeline construction ran some 800 kilometers from Kovyktinskoye field (Irkutsk Region) to the Chayandinskoye field; and the the third phase involved an expansion of gas transmission capacities between the Chayandinskoye field and Blagoveshchensk.   China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. In May 2014, Gazprom and CNPC signed a Sales and Purchase Agreement for gas to be supplied via the eastern route (Power of Siberia gas pipeline).

On November 18, 2008, Asia Trans Gas LLC (or Asia-Trans Gas LLC or СП ООО “Asia TransGas”) — a special purpose vehicle and joint venture of Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited (TAPLINE) [50% equity stake] and Uzbekneftegaz National Holding Company (UNG) [50% equity stake] that was created on January 28, 2008 — signed a $3.5 billion syndicated loan agreement with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BoC) for the Uzbek Sections of Lines A and B of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline Project. CDB's $1.75 billion contribution is captured in Project ID #91901 and BOC's $1.75 billion contribution is captured in Project ID #91917. The borrowing terms of the syndicated loan are unknown. However, it is known that the borrower pledged the pipeline itself as a source of collateral to the lenders. The proceeds of the loan were used by the borrower to finance EPC contracts with China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau, China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Corporation (CPECC), and Zeromax GmbH.  The purpose of the project was to construct the Uzbek sections of Line A and Line B of the 1873 km Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline. These sections both measure 529 km in length and they run parallel to each other from Gedaim on the Turkmen-Uzbek border through central Uzbekistan. The project also involved the construction of three compressor stations. China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau, China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Corporation (CPECC), and Zeromax GmbH were the EPC contractors responsible for project implementation. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on June 30, 2008. Then, on October 1, 2008, the first compressor station of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline was built in Uzbekistan's Qasqadaryo province. The Uzbek section of Line A was put into operation in December 2009. Also, on December 14, 2009, the Presidents of China, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan attended the inauguration ceremony of the China-Central Asia Gas Pipeline at the gas plant on the right bank of the Amu Darya River in Turkmenistan, and turned on the gas flow together. The first batch of gas arrived in China in January 2010.  Then, on June 9, 2010, CNPC signed a framework agreement on the purchase and sale of natural gas with Uzbekneftegaz, which specified that Uzbekistan would supply 10 billion cubic meters of natural gas to China annually. Two months later, in August 2010, the Uzbek section of Line B was officially commissioned. The Uzbek section of Line B became operational in October 2010. A delivery capacity of 30 billion cubic meters per annum was reached by the end of 2011. It was originally envisaged that the Uzbek section of Line A would be built by December 31, 2009 and put into operation by January 2010, while the Uzbek section of Line B would reach completion by December 31, 2011.  Then, on September 21, 2011, CNPC and Uzbekneftegaz signed an agreement on the construction and operation of the Uzbek Section of Line C of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline. In 2013, Asia Trans Gas LLC signed a $1.4 billion syndicated loan agreement with China Development Bank and Bank of China for the Uzbek Section of Line C of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline Project. CDB’s contribution to the syndicated loan amounted to $1.2 billion (captured via Project ID#54528). Given that there are only two known members of the loan syndicate, AidData assumes that Bank of China contributed the remaining $200 million. Bank of China’s contribution is captured via Project ID#91898.  The purpose of the project was to construct the Uzbek section of Line C of the 1873 km Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline. The Uzbek section measures 529 km in length and its runs parallel to Lines A and B from Gedaim on the Turkmenistan-Uzbekistan border through central Uzbekistan. Line C ultimately ends in Horgos, in the Xinjiang region of China. With a designed capacity of 25 billion cubic meters per annum, Line C’s pipe diameter is 1,219 mm, 152 mm larger than Line A and Line B. The total estimated cost of the Uzbek Section of Line C of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline Project was $2.2 billion.  China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. It was notified that the project’s official commencement date was August 1, 2012. Then, on August 10, 2012, the first batch of steel pipes arrived in Uzbekistan. Construction of Line C began on January 16, 2013. The overall welding work for Line C was completed at the end of 2013. Line C went into operation on May 31, 2014 and it was officially commissioned on July 9, 2015. Upon completion of all its supporting facilities by the end of 2015, Line C was expected reach its designed annual deliverability of 25 billion m3.  By the end of 2015, the overall delivery capacity of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline was expected to hit 55 billion cubic m3 per annum (which is equivalent to approximately 20% of China’s natural gas consumption).","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Commercial Bank","Other Joint Venture/Special Purpose Vehicle|Chinese State-owned Company|Chinese State-owned Company|Other Private Sector",2668025363.41083,"The purpose of the project was to construct the Uzbek sections of Line A and Line B of the 1873 km Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline.

58379,"China (People's Republic of)","South Africa","Africa",2018,NA,"China Development Bank provides $2.5 billion loan for 4800MW Kusile Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#52560)","On July 24, 2018, China Development Bank (CDB) and Eskom — South Africa's state-owned energy utility company — signed a $2.5 billion loan (term facility) agreement for the 4800MW Kusile Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project. The loan carries the following borrowing terms: a 15-year maturity, a 5-year grace period, and a 3.7149% interest rate. The borrower is expected to make 20, equal semiannual installments (on March 12 and September 12 of each year) over a 10 year period (after the expiration of the grace period). The South African Government issued a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. However, the interest rate and other key terms and conditions in the loan agreement remain unavailable, as President Ramaphosa indicated that this information will not be made public due to confidentiality clauses. The successful conclusion of the $2.5 billion CDB loan agreement brought Eskom in line with the company’s commitment to secure 62% of its financial year 2018/19 funding requirement. By the end of 2021, the loan’s estimated disbursement rate was 83.62%.   The purpose of the project is to construct the Kusile coal-fired power station (plant), which contains six units with about 800MW capacity each, totaling about 4800MW in the La Faral area of Limpopo, South Africa. The project also includes a power station precinct, power station buildings, administrative buildings, roads, and a high-voltage yard. The total cost of the project is $19.1 billion.   Construction of the Kusile Station commenced on June 5, 2007. However, by April 2011, the project had only achieved a 21% completion rate. In 2015, it was reported that Unit 1 would come online in 2016 and the last unit would come online by 2021. However, the project was still being implemented as of 2022. The expected completion year of the Kusile Power Station is now 2026 (after being pushed back from its originally scheduled completion date of 2023).   Project delays have resulted from the financial management problems of Eskom and the termination of a turbines contract with Alstom. According to IJGlobal, in the 11 years since the project was announced, it has attracted no fewer than 22 banks, export credit agencies, and investment funds all of which offered different services, such as Bank of America (advisory service); Deutsche Bank (loan); JP Morgan (funding plan adviser); Barclays (advisory service); Credit Suisse Group (transaction adviser); Societe Generale (loan); and China Development Bank (loan). The loan from the China Development Bank came at an opportune time as many banks and insurers in Europe, the US, and Japan have in the past few years announced changes to their energy investment policies to exclude financing for new coal-fired power projects.  There are some indications that the $2.5 billion CDB loan for the 4800MW Kusile Coal-Fired Power Plant Construction Project may have underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In February 2019, the CEO of Eskom was asked the following question by a reporter: 'Can you indicate and comment in general terms on the World Bank, DBSA, China Development Bank and other DFI loan covenants, and what may be considered a breach, such as failure to meet required going concern status, debt service coverage ratio and/or other metrics?' He responded that 'I am cautious not to breach the confidentiality of the lenders, but generally speaking, the going-concern status of Eskom is informed by normal credit metrics — interest cover, debt service cover, and so on. When we do find ourselves in a situation where we will not meet these requirements, many of the terms do allow us to put forward an action plan on how it’s going to be resolved.' Then, in February 2023, South Africa’s National Treasury announced that it would would take on ZAR 254 billion ($14 billion) of Eskom's ZAR 423 billion debt that was at risk of default, to enable the state-owned power utility to pay down its principal and interest obligations.","Implementation","Development","Loan","ODA-like","ENERGY","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Recipient State-owned Company",2724624369.69669,"The purpose of this project was to fund the construction of Kusile Power Station in the La Faral area of Limpopo.More detailed location information can be found at: https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/804537693","Upper middle income","Precise","Yes"
61320,"China (People's Republic of)","Indonesia","Asia",2017,NA,"CDB provides $2.3805 billion loan tranche for the Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Rail Project (Linked to Project ID#61321, #61322, and #96344)","The Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Rail (HSR) Project was originally going to be financed by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). In January 2014, JICA included the project in its Overseas Development Aid plan for Indonesia and agreed in principle to bankroll 75% of the total cost of the project at a 0.1% interest rate so long as the host government provided a loan repayment guarantee. However, Beijing was determined to win the contract for the HSR project and sought to outcompete Tokyo on several dimensions, including cost, speed of implementation, and level of public liability. In early 2015, Indonesian President Joko Jokowi invited China to submit an alternative proposal, and it proposed a lower cost version of the project that could be fully-financed with a government-guaranteed (CDB) loan at a 2% interest rate and implemented on a shorter timeline (3 years rather than 5 years).   Then, in September 2015, when President Jokowi was expected to announce the winning bidder, he surprised everyone by rejecting Beijing’s offer and Tokyo’s offer and “cancelling” the project. The stated rationale for his decision was that the project would lead to a ballooning of public debt. Tokyo responded by offering a 50% reduction in the amount of debt that would need to be backed by a sovereign guarantee. Beijing responded by scrapping the sovereign guarantee requirement altogether and proposing an off-public balance sheet transaction, in which CDB would work around the country’s public debt ceiling by extending a loan to a special purpose vehicle (jointly owned by Chinese and Indonesian state-owned companies) rather than the Government of Indonesia. Beijing’s revised offer was sufficiently attractive to seal the deal.   On October 16, 2015, a consortium of Indonesian state-owned companies (called PT Pilar Sinergi BUMN) and a consortium of Chinese state-owned companies (called Beijing Yawan HSR Co Ltd) established a joint venture and special purpose vehicle called PT Kereta Cepat Indonesia China (also known as PT Kereta Api Indonesia China or KCIC) to design, finance, implement, and manage the Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Rail Project. PT Pilar Sinergi BUMN (PSBI) — a joint venture of PT Wijaya Karya Tbk (38% ownership stake), PT Kereta Api Indonesia (25% ownership stake), PT Perkebunan Nusantara VIII (25% ownership stake), and PT Jasa Marga (Persero) Tbk. (12%) ownership stake — holds a 60% ownership stake (shareholding interest) in KCIC. Beijing Yawan HSR Co Ltd — a joint venture of China Railway International Co. Ltd., China Railway Group Limited, Sinohydro Corporation Limited, CRRC Corporation Limited, and China Railway Signal and Communication Corp. — holds the remaining 40% ownership stake (shareholding interest) in KCIC. Then, on May 14, 2017, China Development Bank (CDB) signed a $3.9675 billion loan agreement with KCIC for the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Rail Project.   The loan consists of two tranches: a USD-denominated tranche worth $2.3805 billion (captured via Project ID#61320) and an RMB-denominated tranche worth $1.587 billion (captured via Project ID#61321). The USD-denominated tranche carries the following borrowing terms: 40-year maturity, 10 year grace period, 2% interest rate, and no sovereign guarantee. The RMB-denominated tranche carries the following borrowing terms: 40-year maturity, 10 year grace period, 3.46% interest rate, and no sovereign guarantee. ICBC is the security agent for the loan. The borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance an EPC contract between KCIC and seven Indonesian and Chinese state-owned firms, which was signed on April 4, 2017. The total cost of the Jakarta-Bandung HSR Project is $5.29 billion and it is being financed according to a 75:25 debt-to-equity ratio. The equity contribution of Beijing Yawan HSR Co Ltd. is captured via Project ID#61322.   The purpose of the Jakarta-Bandung HSR Project is to construct a 142.3 km high-speed railway from the city of Jakarta to Bandung, the capital of West Java. Upon completion, the railway is expected to reduce the travel time between Jakarta and Bandung from more than 3 hours to less than 40 minutes. Construction began on January 21, 2016. However, the first CDB loan disbursement ($170 million) did not occur until May 2018. CDB planned to disburse another $1.1 billion before the end of July 2018. In May 2019, the 608-meter Walini tunnel was built. By September 2019, 32.8% of the project’s construction activities were complete and land acquisition progress reached 99%. By mid-February 2020, construction progress had reached 44% and land acquisition progress reached 99.96%. Then, in March 2020, the 442-meter No.5 tunnel was finished. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, work on the project was temporarily halted during the spring of 2020. Construction resumed in June 2020, and as of September 2020, the Director of KCIC Xin Xuezhong reported that construction progress had reached 60% and land acquisition progress had reached 100%.   The Jakarta-Bandung HSR Project, which was originally scheduled for completion in May 2019, has encountered a number of different problems during implementation. First, Indonesia Law No. 32/2009 regarding Environment Management and Control requires an environmental impact assessment (EIA) be developed over at least one year (and include analysis for both dry and rainy seasons) for a project of the Jakarta-Bandung HSR’s scale. However, the EIA for the project was completed in less than 6 months, and environmental NGOs claim that it contains inaccurate and flawed data analysis regarding the project’s actual environmental impacts. Second, the project reportedly violated Government Regulation No. 27/2012 regarding environmental permits, which requires public participation in the making of the EIA document. Environmental NGOs claim that, due to a lack of public participation in the EIA process, the project has serious design defects, including a planned route through numerous geological faults, which has led to delays, cost overruns, and local opposition. Third, although KCIC exclusively appointed PT Pilar Sinergi, a state-owned enterprise to deal with land acquisition issues, the process has not proceeded as smoothly as the Indonesian government had hoped. In July 2018, three lawsuits resulted in legal approval from the courts to proceed with claims seeking compensation for their properties affected by the project. Fourth, Indonesia’s Ministry of Public Works and Public Housing (PUPR) ordered a temporary halt to the project on March 2, 2020 after flooding blocked the main toll road between Jakarta and the city of Cikampe. Acting Director General of Public Works Danis Sumadilaga said piles of soil dumped on roadsides had buried drainage channels and caused the flooding, adding that shoddy management practices paid scant attention to health, safety, and environmental degradation concerns. Fifth, during the construction process, gas pipelines owned by the national Pertamina Oil Company were damaged, which caused an explosion and killed a Chinese worker in Melong, near Cimahi town. Sixth, blasting work for tunnels in the area of the Tipar Sari Asih housing complex in the West Java town of Cimahi has caused serious damage. According to Meiki Paendong, executive director of WALHI West Java, an environmental NGO based in Bandung, “[m]any walls of [nearby] houses cracked … [and] there was information that [the company] would examine the impact, but until now, the results of the inspection have not been made public.” Seventh, when flooding hit the Jakarta suburb of Bekasi in January 2020, Deputy Mayor Tri Ardhianto Tjahyono pointed to the HSR project as a cause, as did officials in the West Bandung regency which also flooded. Arief Maulana, head of Bekasi City Public Works and Water Management, said that “[o]ne of KCIC effects… is the problem of drainage control in several project activity locations, which are close to the drainage area that causes sedimentation and also disrupted waterways.” Maulana argued that it is the responsibility of KCIC to fix all drainage damage due to the project. KCIC eventually agreed to repair and restore the drainage system after the State-Owned Enterprises Ministry demanded an assessment of the project in March 2020, due to environmental degradation concerns. Meiki Paendong, executive director of WALHI West Java, argues that the flooding in Bekasi and elsewhere demonstrated that the project’s EIA was flawed, as it failed to address the closure and loss of drainage flows due to land-use change. For example, drainage canals were covered by landfills, which reportedly increased flooding throughout the rainy season.   In 2015, Indonesian President Joko Jokowi signed a decree prohibiting the use of government funds for the Jakarta-Bandung High Speed Rail Project. However, during implementation, the project encountered major cost overruns worth an estimated $2 billion due to various factors, including but not limited to higher-than-expected land procurement costs, delays in construction due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the rising prices of materials, and additional project insurance costs and debt service reserve account (DSRA) requirements. Then, in October 2021, President Jokowi reversed course, issuing a new decree and authorizing a government bailout of the Jakarta-Bandung HSR Project. The Indonesian government reportedly authorized the use of $286.7 million from state coffers to inject liquidity into PT Kereta Cepat Indonesia China (the borrowing institution) in the next fiscal year. It also made clear that it was prepared to provide additional funding on an as needed basis. At the time, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Ministry of State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), said that ‘like it or not, … we have to ask the government to participate in funding the project if we want it to be finished on time.’ Then, in July 2022, the project’s prime contractor (PT KCIC) reported that the project had achieved an 85% completion rate. At that time, Jakarta-Bandung HSR saw the laying of ballasted tracks begin on its main line. One month later, in August 2022, high-speed bullet trains for the Indonesian Jakarta-Bandung HSR rolled off the assembly line in Qingdao within China’s Shandong Province. Eleven pairs of high-speed electric multiple units (EMUs) and one set of comprehensive testing bullet railcars were ready to be shipped to Indonesia.   As of August 2022, all Jakarta-Bandung HSR tunnels had been completed and more than 90 percent of the subgrade, bridge and station civil works had been completed. By October 2022, the project had achieved a 88.8% completion rate. Also, during the last quarter of calendar year 2022, Indonesian state auditor BPKP reported that the cost overruns associated with the Jakarta-Bandung HSR Project were just under $1.5 billion (rather than the earlier estimate of $2 billion). On October 18, 2022, Indonesia’s Deputy Minister of SOEs Kartiko Wirjoatmodjo announced that ‘[w]e are currently in the final negotiation with CDB for additional loans for cost overruns'. He also indicated that KCIC would contract one or more supplementary loans worth $1.03 billion (IDR 16.1 trillion) from CDB to cover approximately 75% of the project’s cost overruns (worth $1.45 billion). Then, on November 9, 2022, KCIC Director Dwiyana Slamet Riyadi told a legislative committee that the project’s cash flow would run out by the end of the month and China’s National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) agreed that 75% of the project’s cost overruns should be funded with the proceeds of an additional CDB loan. At the time, KCIC was also asking parliament to make another IDR 3.22 million cash injection into the project company (as an additional equity contribution on behalf of PSBI) in conjunction with an additional IDR 2.15 trillion equity contribution from Beijing Yawan HSR Co Ltd. KCIC Director Dwiyana Slamet Riyadi told the legislative committee that completing the project by June 2023 would require receipt of additional project debt and equity by the end of November 2022.   On March 31, 2023, the track laying of the whole line of the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway was completed. Then, on April 10, 2023, Indonesia' Chief Investment Affairs Minister Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan said that KCIC had been working with CDB to lower the interest rate attached to the supplementary loan to cover the project's cost overruns. The Indonesian Government proposed a $560 million loan at a 2%interest rate from China Development Bank (CDB) to pay for the cost overruns. In April 2023, Luhut told a press briefing in Jakarta that '[CDB] is already willing to bring the interest down from 4 percent. The first offer is a reduction from 4 percent to 3.4 percent, but we want it to be even lower. [...] We do want a 2 percent interest, but it is impossible to have everything [we want] come true. If you ask for loans [outside China], the interest can go up to 6 percent. So if we end up with a 3.4-percent rate, we are doing okay, although not that okay. But that would be better than [borrowing money from other countries].' Luhut also noted that a 3.4 percent interest rate would not necessarily be problematic: 'Do not underestimate our country. We are getting better. Our state tax revenue has grown by 48.6 percent [in January 2023] thanks to better efficiency with digitalization, etc.'  As of April 2023, the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway was expected to launch its commercial operations on August 18, 2023 — one day after the 78th anniversary of Indonesia's independence day.  Then, in May 2023, Indonesia’s Transport Ministry and three consulting firms -- Mott MacDonald, PwC and local law firm Umbra -- pushed back on the suggestion that the project could achieve full-fledged commercial operations by August 18, 2023. At the time, the Chinese participants in KCIC reportedly wanted a full operational worthiness certificate for the Jakarta-Bandung HSC despite the incomplete construction of a railway station, but the Indonesian Transport Ministry and its consultants suggested that KCIC might not achieve full-fledged commercial operations until December 31, 2023.   Then, in June 2023, Reuters reported that KCIC was still in negotiations with CDB over a $560 million supplemental loan (captured via captured via Project ID#96344). After CDB offered an interest rate of 3.46% on the loan's RMB-denominated tranche, KCIC reportedly countered with a 2.8% interest rate request.","Implementation","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","TRANSPORT AND STORAGE","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Other Joint Venture/Special Purpose Vehicle",2743140982.78842,"The purpose of the project is to construct a 142.3 km high-speed railway from the city of Jakarta to Bandung, the capital of West Java.

Borrowings through the line of credit were to be used for the development of infrastructure and resource projects in Kazakhstan. Then, on October 13, 2009, KAZ Minerals PLC (also known as ‘Kazakhmys Corporation LLC’ and ‘Kazakhmys’) announced that it was in discussions with CDB and Samruk-Kazyna regarding a major unsecured loan facility.  Following a memorandum of financial cooperation that was signed by Kazakhmys, Samruk-Kazyna and CDB on November 14, 2009, $2.7 billion from the $3 billion line of credit was allocated to various projects of KAZ Minerals PLC. Then, on December 30, 2009, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC (also known as Kazakhmys Finance PLC) — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of KAZ Minerals PLC — and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $2 billion facility (loan) agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project. On the same day, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $100 million facility (loan) agreement for the Bozymchak Copper and Gold Mine Development Project. Thirteen days later, on January 12, 2010, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project. Then, on June 11, 2012, KAZ Minerals Finance PLC and Samruk-Kazyna signed two additional loan agreements: a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and a $200 million facility (loan) agreement for the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All five loan agreements (collectively worth $2.7 billion) were financed by Samruk-Kazyna via borrowings from the $3 billion CDB line of credit.  All of the loans carried the following borrowing terms: maturities of between 12 and 15 years (with final maturity dates falling between January 2022 and August 2025), 3 year grace periods (with the first loan repayment scheduled for January 2013), annual interest rates of LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin, and 1.5% management fees. A separate fee of $3 million was also payable under the loan agreements for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Project and the Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project. All of the loans were also backed by repayment guarantees from KAZ Minerals PLC and a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna. All five loans reportedly disbursed in full by January 2013. The remaining $300 million under the $3 billion CDB line of credit was utilized (drawn down) by Samruk-Kazyna for an unknown purposes and fully repaid in January 2013. In January 2014, KAZ Minerals PLC fully repaid its loans for the Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project and Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project (since the development of these projects was no longer expected to commence in the near future). Then, on December 29, 2014, two of the loan agreements that KAZ Minerals Finance PLC had previously signed with Samruk-Kazyna (via on-lending from the CDB line of credit) were transformed into bilateral loan agreements with CDB: the loan agreement for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project and the loan agreement for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project. At that time, the face value of the loan for the Bozshakol Copper Mine Development Project was $1,844,000,000 (most likely because some repayments were made between January 2013 and December 2014) and the face value of the loan for the Bozymchak Copper Mine Development Project was upsized to $148,500,000 (for an unknown reason). At that time the borrowing, terms of the two loans with outstanding balances were rescheduled.  The interest rate was lowered from LIBOR plus a 4.80% margin to LIBOR plus a 4.50% margin; and an arrangement fee of 0.5% was agreed upon, of which 60% was paid in December 2014 and 40% was paid in January 2016. The maturities and grace periods of the loan were left unchanged. KAZ Minerals PLC continued to serve as a guarantor for the loans. However, as an additional credit enhancement, the borrower pledged a $100,000,000 minimum cash balance in a charge account (collection account) as a source of collateral. The amended, bilateral loan (facility) agreements between CDB and KAZ Minerals also clarified that the loan proceeds were to be used by the borrower ‘principally for the development of the Bozshakol and Bozymchak [mine] projects.’ As of December 31, 2020, $1.0 billion was drawn down by the borrower under the $1,844,000,000 CDB loan agreement and the $148,500,000 CDB loan agreement. During 2020, the borrower made a $183 million repayment. An additional $181 million repayment was due in 2021. Both CDB loans are repayable in semi-annual installments each January and July with final maturity dates in August 2025.

Approximately 42.000 m³ of concrete production and 5.000 tons of steel construction were completed by May 2013. The panel coating works of the process buildings started in May 2013. The project was originally scheduled to reach completion on March 15, 2015.  The completion of construction activities and the commencement of commissioning works was ultimately held on September 29, 2016. The Bozymchak mine is an open-pit copper and gold mine and concentrator in Ala-Bukinsky region, Jalal-Abad, Kyrgyzstan (exact locational coordinates: 41.2586, 71.0647). It is estimated to contain combined indicated and inferred resources of 16.5 million tons with 0.95% copper and 1.58 g/t gold. The scope of the project involved the development of the mine and its ancillary facilities. NFC was responsible for implementation. The project’s pre-feasibility study was completed in July 2008. It was originally expected to reach completion by December 2014. However, the mine was not initially commissioned until March 2014. The mine was fully commissioned and reached its commercial operations date (COD) on or around August 5, 2015. The Bozymchak mine restarted operations on December 26, 2020 after a temporary suspension that began on October 7, 2020, following political instability in the Kyrgyz Republic. The Abyz Copper Mine and Nurkazgan Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Abyz copper mine and the Nurkazgan copper mine (exact locational coordinates: 50.16861, 73.00333). Stripping works at Abyz mine commenced in January 2014. At that time, it was expected that the mine would recommence production in Q3 of 2014. The Akbastau-Kosmurun Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Akbastau-Kosmurun copper mine (exact locational coordinates: 48.60611,77.78861 and 48.6437, 77.7102). The project commenced on January 30, 2009. Its completion date is unknown. The Zhomart Copper Mine Development Project involved the development of the Zhomart copper mine, which exploits the 14 km long Zhaman-Aybat orefield deposits that are located approximately 160 km southeast of Dzhezkazgan. The first stage of the mine’s development was commissioned in 2006 with a planned capacity of around 4 million tons of ore a year. The second phase of the project was schedule for implementation from 2012 to 2017 with a production start in 2018. The de facto completion date of the $300 million loan that Samruk-Kazyna contracted for an unspecified purpose was January 2013 (when it was fully repaid).","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Other Private Sector|Chinese State-owned Company",2769706529.01871,"Bozymchak is an open-pit copper mine and concentrator in Ala-Bukinsky region, Jalal-Abad, Kyrgyzstan.

Canada-based Peru Copper Inc. originally owned 91% of shares and the remaining 9% were owned by unspecified firms. Shortly thereafter, all of the mining concessions in Toromocho were transferred to Chinalco's wholly-owned subsidiary, Minera Chinalco Peru S.A. (Chinalco Peru).  Then, on December 1, 2010, China Eximbank and Minera Chinalco Perú S.A. ('Chinalco Peru') — a special purpose vehicle and wholly owned subsidiary of Aluminum Corporation of China Limited (Chinalco) — signed a $2 billion overseas investment loan to finance capital expenditures related to the Toromocho Copper Mine Project (captured via Project #36064). The loan carried an interest rate 6-month LIBOR plus 185 basis points. However, its other borrowing terms are unknown. The parent company Chinalco entered into a guarantee agreement with China Eximbank for the entire outstanding amount, accrued interest, penalties and other expenses arising from the loan from China Eximbank. Chinalco was also required to pay a 1% commission for each drawdown. This overseas investment loan facility is secured by (i.e. collateralized against) all property, plant and equipment pertaining to the Toromocho Project if Chinalco’s credibility or financial status deteriorates. In March 2013, China Eximbank and Chinalco Peru signed a supplementary overseas investment loan (facility) agreement worth $419 million for additional capital expenditures related to the Toromocho Copper Mine Project (captured via Project #56098). The loan carried an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 350 basis points. The other borrowing terms are unknown. Chinalco Peru was required to pay a 1% commission fee for each drawdown and this second facility was also guaranteed by the parent company of Chinalco. The supplementary loan agreement was also collateralized against all property, plant and equipment pertaining to the Toromocho Mining Project if Chinalco’s credibility or financial status deteriorates. As of 2016, the entirety of this loan facility was drawn down.   The Toromocho Project is located in central Peru in the core of the Morococha mining district. It is one of the largest copper mines in the world, and the first greenfield copper mine developed by a Chinese corporation abroad. Upon completion, the project was expected to boost overall copper exports from Peru by 25%.   CCCC Del Peru SAC (subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company, Ltd.) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. The Environmental Impact Assessment of the Toromocho Copper Mine Project was approved by the Peruvian government in December 2010. Chinalco Peru obtained the construction permit and began work in July 2011. The mines were officially commissioned on December 10, 2013. However, three months after its inauguration, the operation of the mine was suspended by Peru’s Environment Assessment and Enforcement Agency (OEFA) after it discovered illegal discharge of acid effluents in two nearby lakes. Chinalco quickly resolved this matter by building improved drainage and explained the incident as a result of unusual heavy rainfall which caused unexpected acid runoffs.

52663,"China (People's Republic of)","Bangladesh","Asia",2018,NA,"China Eximbank provides $2.67 billion preferential buyer's credit for Padma Bridge Rail Link Project (Linked to Project ID#52765)","In January 2015, the Chinese Government proposed loans worth $15 to $20 billion to finance the expansion of various railways in Bangladesh. Soon thereafter, Bangladesh's Ministry of Railways sent a set of projects to the Economic Relations Division (ERD) of Bangladesh's Ministry of Finance to inquire about potential Chinese financing. Then, Bangladesh’s Ministry of Finance sent a list of projects, including the Padma Bridge Rail Project, to the Chinese Government. At that point, Bangladesh's Ministry of Railways had already signed memoranda of understanding (MoUs) with China Railway Group Limited for the Padma Bridge Rail Project. Then, on August 8, 2016, Bangladesh Railway and China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC) signed a $3.13 billion commercial contract for the construction of a 172-kilometer-long railway line from Dhaka to Jessore crossing through the Padma Bridge. Two months later, in October 2016, during the state visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to Bangladesh, the Chinese Government and the Government of Bangladesh signed an MoU on the Padma Bridge Rail Link Project.    However, the project hit a snag because of disagreements between the Chinese Government and the Government of Bangladesh on the face value and interest rate of the proposed loan for the project. The Bangladesh's Ministry of Railways requested that the project begin implementation in January 2017 in order to be completed by the time the Padma Bridge was completed. However, a loan agreement with China Eximbank had yet to be signed and was scheduled to be signed on December 16, 2017. This date came and past, despite attempts of Bangladeshi authorities — including the Prime Minister's Office — to contact their Chinese counterparts to finalize the loan. The Government of Bangladesh had wanted the project to be completed before Bangladesh's December 2018 general elections.    Specific issues relating to the face value of the loan were related to major increases in the cost of land acquisition. China Eximbank disagreed with the Government of Bangladesh over the costs of the land acquisition. As a result, China Eximbank reduced the promised loan amount by 15% (from approximately ৳247.490 billion BDT to ৳210.36 billion BDT) and turned its previously promised ‘soft loan’ (most likely a governmental concessional loan) into a preferential buyer's credit. As a result, the Government of Bangladesh was forced to increase its counterpart funding contribution from ৳102 billion BDT to ৳190.43 billion BDT.    Then, on February 2, 2018, China Eximbank sent a letter to the Government of Bangladesh informing them that it would begin the process of signing the loan agreement. To ensure that China Eximbank would issue the loan for the Padma Bridge Rail Link Project promptly, in early February 2018 (presumably after the China Eximbank letter was received), the Government of Bangladesh approved ‘on an urgent basis’ a China Eximbank government concessional loan worth RMB 1,547,071,939.09 ($231.5 million) for the Modernization of Telecommunication Network for Digital Connectivity Project (MOTN) (captured via Project ID#52765) because the ‘[d]elay in offering the green signal to the Chinese assistance [for the telecommunications modernization project] was affecting the implementation of the [Padma Bridge Rail Link Project].’ The Government of Bangladesh had previous problems with the MOTN loan and delayed approving it, which provoked concerns among the Chinese authorities. To address these concerns and advance the Padma Bridge Rail Link Project, the Government of Bangladesh approved the MOTN loan. Then, China’s State Council provided its approval for China Eximbank to issue a loan for the Padma Bridge Rail Link Project in February 2018. The Chinese Government sent the loan agreement to the Bangladeshi Government by the end of February for final review and countersignature.    Then, on April 27, 2018, China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh signed the $2,667,940,000 preferential buyer's credit (PBC) agreement for the Padma Bridge Rail Link Project (PBRLP). The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 2%, a grace period of 6 years, a maturity period of 20 years, a management fee of 0.25%, and a commitment fee of 0.25%. The proceeds of the PBC were to be used by the borrower to finance 85% of the cost of a $3,138,750,000 commercial contract between the Government of Bangladesh and CREC, which was signed in August 2016. The Government of Bangladesh is responsible for covering the remaining 15% ($470.81 million).    According to the Government of Bangladesh’s Economic Relations Division (ERD), the PBC had achieved a disbursement rate of 20% ($533,588,000 out of $2,667,940,000) as of June 30, 2020 and a 40.4% disbursement rate ($1,079,727,000 out of $2,667,940,000) as of June 30, 2021.  According to the Government of Bangladesh’s ERD, the borrower had not made any repayments under the PBC as of June 30, 2021. The purpose of the project is to construct a new railway track that runs from the city of Dhaka to the city of Jessore via Padma Multipurpose Bridge to establish new Broad Gauge (BG) railway connectivity through south-west part of the country. The project is being implemented in 2 phases. The first phase is an 82 kilometer section from Dhaka to Bhanga, and the second phase is a Bhanga to Jessore section. The project involves the construction of 215.22 km of rail track, including loops and sidings; 23.38 km of viaducts, 1.98 km of ramps, 66 major bridges, 244 minor bridges and culverts, 1 highway overpass, and 29 level crossings. The project also includes the construction of 14 new station buildings, remodeling of 6 existing station buildings, the supply of 100 passenger coaches, and the acquisition of 1796 acres of land. 172 kilometer of track is to be laid between Dhaka to Jessore via Padam Bridge and Bhanga of Faridpur, while 43.2 km of track was set to be lines loop lines. 23 kilometers of the rail line is set to be elevated. The single-track rail line is designed to accommodate a maximum speed of 120 kilometers per hour. Construction of the railway is expected to impact the living accommodations of 7,705 people, necessitating resettlement arrangements.    The PBRLP seeks to establish a rail-based transportation network with nine southern districts including the Port of Mongla and Benapole Land Port through the 6.15-kilometer Padma Bridge (which was still under construction when this project began implementation). The route is to be constructed in four sections: Dhaka-Gendaria, Gendaria-Mawa, Mawa-Bhanga junction via Padma Bridge and Bhanga-Jessore Bridge. The 50-kilometer-long Mawa-Bhanga junction-Bhanga via Padma Bridge section was originally expected to be completed by the end of 2018 to allow trains to travel over the bridge on the day of its inauguration. The project, part of the Bangladesh-China-India-Myanmar Economic Corridor (BCIM) of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), is expected to cut the travel time from Dhaka to Kolkata, West Bengal, India by five hours and time from Dhaka to Khulna in southern Bangladesh from nine hours to 3 hours.  CREC is the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. China Railway First Group Co, Ltd. (CRFG) — a subsidiary of China Railway Group Limited — is also involved in project implementation. The Engineering Corps of Bangladesh Army and Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology have also served as consultants for the project. Bangladesh Railway is the main executing agency on behalf of the Bangladeshi Government, while Bangladesh's Ministry of Railways (MoR) is the ‘sponsoring ministry.’ After the signing of the loan agreement, construction was placed under the supervision of Fast Track Project Monitoring Committee, headed by Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina.    Project implementation commenced on July 3, 2018, with an intended completion date of June 2022. However, even by May 2018, before implementation had commenced, Bangladesh Railways officials were attempting to secure an extension of implementation from June 2022 to June 2024 due to the previously described delays relating to the loan. Prime Minister Hasina officially inaugurated work on the project on October 14, 2018, despite the commencement of construction works several months prior.     By November 2020, the project had achieved a 28.28% completion rate, despite the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The expected project completion date at that time was June 2024, and the Mawa-Bhanga junction-Bhanga via Padma Bridge section was to be set to be open in 2021 (although this section was originally scheduled to be opened by the end of 2018). On August 23, 2021, the installation of all road slabs on Padma Bridge was completed. In total, 2,917 road slabs and 2,959 railway slabs were installed on the 6.15 km-long bridge. As of November 2021, the physical works of the main structure of the Padma Bridge had achieved a 95% completion rate and the overall progress of the bridge construction stood at an 88.75% completion rate.

The establishment of the NAC seeks to alleviate Greater Cairo’s increasing densification and establish a new growth hub for future generations. It will house Egypt’s 29 government ministries and contain 20 residential neighborhoods, an airport, hotels, malls, parks. Upon completion, it is projected to have enough space to accommodate 6.5 million inhabitants. In January 2016, the Egyptian Government and China State Construction Engineering Corporation Ltd. (CSCEC) signed a general contracting framework agreement regarding a project to construct the Central Business District (CBD) of the NAC. Then, on October 11, 2017, at a launch ceremony for the NAC Project, Egyptian Minister of Housing, Public Facilities, and Urban Development, Mustafa Mabdili, signed a general (commercial) contract worth $3,000,000,000 for the construction of the Central Business District (CBD) of the NAC with the Vice President of CSCEC, Zheng Xuexuan. The contract specifies that CSCEC is responsible for the construction of 18 high-rise towers (including administrative offices, hotels, entertainment facilities, and the tallest tower in Africa), which were organized into three batches and scheduled for financing via three separate loan tranches (all of which have reached financial close).    Then, on April 28, 2019, a consortium of Chinese state-owned banks signed a $2.76 billion syndicated (buyer’s credit) loan agreement with the New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA) — an Egyptian Government authority affiliated with the Ministry of Housing — for the construction of the Central Business District (CBD) in the NAC. Participants in the loan syndicate include the Export-Import Bank of China (China Eximbank), the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), and Bank of China (BOC). ICBC is the lead arranger of the syndicated loan and it contributed $610 million to the syndicate. The borrower was to use the proceeds of the loan to finance 85% of the cost of the $3,000,000,000 commercial contract that was signed with CSCEC on October 11, 2017. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: a 13.5-year maturity, a 3-year grace period, and 2-3% interest rate.  The Government of Egypt reportedly provided a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan. Sinosure provided $3.88 billion of buyer’s credit insurance (to cover the loan’s principal and interest). The Sinosure-covered project cashflow analysis reportedly accounted for projected apartment rental and sales, hotel & retail rentals, and centralized advertising revenues. The first tranche of the syndicated loan’s three tranches was worth $843,000,000 and it was earmarked for the construction of seven high-rise towers (5 residential and 2 commercial towers) in the CBD. Then, in July 2019, NUCA signed an agreement with eight Chinese banks (including ICBC) and HSBC Bank Middle East Limited to receive the second tranche of the loan (also known as the “Batch 2 Towers” Project). On December 24, 2020, the Egyptian Government announced that the third and final loan tranche would soon be disbursed and NUCA signed an agreement with seven Chinese banks (including ICBC, Bank of China, China Eximbank, China Construction Bank, Bank of Communications, Postal Savings Bank of China, and China CITIC Bank) to receive the third tranche of the loan (also known as the “Batch 3 Towers” Project). The first tranche was due to be disbursed in January 2020. However, on January 31, 2020, Al Monitor — an Egyptian newspaper — reported that the first tranche of the loan had not disbursed as expected in January 2020. According to the newspaper, the Egyptian government did not initially meet conditions attached to the loan facility and the Chinese bank syndicate was concerned about whether the Egyptian government could repay the loan.    The CBD is located in the center of Egypt’s New Administrative Capital, 45 km east of Cairo. The CBD is expected to cover 505,000 m^2, and it include Africa’s tallest building at 385.8 meter named “Iconic Tower” (Arabic: البرج الأيقوني‎), 12 high rise commercial office buildings, 5 high-rise apartments, 2 hotels, and a total of 18 high rise buildings and municipal projects. CSCEC’s Eighth Bureau is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation and it has reportedly provided direct employment opportunities for 5,000 workers, while indirectly employing 30,000 people.    Dar al-Handasah Shair & Partners is responsible for architectural design and supervision. Project implementation commenced on May 2, 2018. On February 26, 2019, the foundation bottom slab concreting of the main building of the Iconic Tower was completed. In March 2020, the structural frame of the CO3 Office Building was completed and the first curtain wall body was installed for the C04 Tower (Commercial Building), which marked the beginning of the external curtain wall installation stage. Construction activities continued during the Covid-19 pandemic. On October 25, 2020, a topping-off ceremony was held for the 27-floor, C12 Tower (Commercial Building) Then, on June 17, 2021, a topping-off ceremony was held for the 385.8 meter, 80-storey Iconic Tower (which was planned and inspired by the shape of a pharaonic obelisk with glass exterior). CSCEC reported in 2021 that it had completed the construction of 13 buildings in the NAC, including the Iconic Tower (also known as the C03 Tower). As of September 2022, the project had completed the main construction of all 20 buildings and had entered the decoration and electromechanical installation stage. At that time, the project as a whole was expected to reach completion by the end of 2023.

This loan carries a 15-year maturity and it is apparently collateralized against NOVATEK’s 60% equity stake in Arctic LNG-2 LLC. As of September 30, 2021, about 52% of the total planned capital expenditures of Arctic LNG 2 Project had been financed. Then, on November 30, 2021, Arctic LNG 2 LLC announced the signing of loan agreements with a group international financial institutions and commercial banks. The maximum aggregate borrowing amount under the loan facilities to be provided by the Russian and international banks is EUR 9.5 billion for up to 15 years. These credit facility agreements including buyer’s credit facility agreements with China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China worth EUR 2.5 billion. The borrower also purchased buyer’s credit insurance from Sinosure. Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC) also issued a loan to Arctic LNG 2.   The loan proceeds are to be used by the borrower to finance an EPC contract with TechnipFMC, which was signed in July 2019.  The purpose of the project is to create a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility consisting of three trains, each using concrete gravity-based structures. The LNG facility will be located in the Gydan Peninsula in Siberia. Upon completion, its expected annual LNG production capacity is 19.8 million metric tons per year. TechnipFMC — a joint venture of Technip Energies, Saipem and NIPIGAS — is the general EPC contractor responsible for implementation. Wison Offshore and Marine Ltd is a subcontractor involved in the project; its scope of work is engineering, procurement, fabrication, and commissioning of modules in train one with a total weight of 48,000 MT. The project’s front-end engineering design (FEED) was completed in October 2018. A final investment decision (FID) made in September 2019.   On June 17, 2021, the first plane landed at the Utrenniy airport built specifically for the Arctic LNG 2 project on the Gydan Peninsula in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Region.  Shanghai-based Wison Offshore and Marine Ltd, a subsidiary of privately owned Chinese conglomerate Wison Group, shipped the first two of four giant industrial modules for the Arctic LNG 2 project of Novatek, the largest independent natural gas producer of Russia, on August 26, 2021. The modules dispatched from Zhoushan shipyard were slated to arrive in Russia's Arctic port city of Murmansk after 25 days. On September 21, 2021. Arctic LNG 2 LLC announced that the first modules for LNG Train 1 were successfully delivered. The two first pipe-rack modules weighing approximately nine thousand tons each were shipped from the Zhoushan port in China to the NOVATEK-Murmansk LNG Construction Center and were to be further skidded onto the Gravity Base Structure, or GBS, platform of LNG Train 1. The next two modules were loaded onto a transport ship and put in transit to Murmansk. Overall, 14 modules are schedule to be delivered from contractors' shipyards for the first LNG train. By the end of the third quarter 2021, the project had achieved a 52% completion rate and the first train was roughly 69% complete.   However, the project encountered significant implementation obstacles and delays in 2022. Technip Energies warned in April 2022 that international sanctions (resulting from Russia's military invasion of Ukraine), would complicate the completion of the project. Technip’s CEO Arnaud Pieton said at the time that '[t]he European sanctions now target LNG goods and technology and services more directly, I would say, making the execution of [Arctic LNG 2] more complicated, maybe even highly complicated.' Then, work on train three was halted on on April 29, 2022 and work on train two was halted on May 27, 2022. All foreign workers were to leave their work sites by the end of May 2022, which placed the borrowing institution (Arctic LNG 2 LLC) and its contractors in a race against time to procure essential equipment and technology before deliveries to Russia became much harder or impossible. However, in January 2023, Novatek ordered Chinese yards to restart work on LNG modules destined for the Arctic LNG 2 Project, after an eight-month hiatus in activities related European sanctions on Russia.   There are also indications that the Arctic LNG 2 Project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of its lenders. In February 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued Directive 3 Under Executive Order 14024, which prohibited U.S. persons from engaging in all transactions in, provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of greater than 14 days maturity and new equity issued by 13 Russian state-owned enterprises and entities, as well as their subsidiaries, on or after March 26, 2022. The entities included Transneft, Sberbank, AlfaBank, Credit Bank of Moscow, Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Rostelecom, RusHydro, Alrosa, Sovcomflot, and Russian Railways. Then, on March 5, 2022, the Russian Government issued Presidential Decree No. 95, which required that Russian borrowers make payments to foreign creditors from ‘unfriendly states’—including most countries that imposed sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine—in Russian rubles (irrespective of the currency of the loan), unless a permission to make direct payments in the contractual currency was granted by either the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) or Russia’s Ministry of Finance. This measure made it substantially more difficult for Russian borrowers to make timely payments on foreign- and local-currency debt to certain international creditors in their original currencies of denomination.  Then, in June 2022, the Russian Government defaulted on some of its dollar-denominated and euro-denominated debt.  Two months earlier, in April 2022, France’s Total, announced a $4.1 billion impairment and Japan's Mitsui & Co, Ltd. decided to take a write-off related to its 10 percent equity stake in the Arctic LNG 2 Project. Mitsui & Co, Ltd. reported that it had recorded a loss of $162 million related to its investment in project as a result of higher loan and guarantee obligations stemming from a worsening Russian credit rating. The fact that at least two of Arctic LNG 2 LLC's lenders (Sberbank and Gazprombank) faced international sanctions in 2022 and 2023 also complicated the implementation of the project.","Implementation","Commercial","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank|State-owned Policy Bank","Other Private Sector|Chinese Private Sector",2941176470.58823,"The purpose of the project is to create a liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility consisting of three trains, each using concrete gravity-based structures.

73145,"China (People's Republic of)","Democratic Republic of the Congo","Africa",2008,NA,"China Eximbank provides $2.0299 billion loan for Phase 1 and Phase 2 of Sicomines Copper and Cobalt Mining Project (Linked to Project ID#450, #73204, #91875, and #91873)","On September 17, 2007, a consortium consisting of China Eximbank, China Railways Construction Company (CREC), and Sinohydro and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo signed a “protocol d’accord” (or “项目换资源协议”). According to the terms of the agreement, CREC and Sinohydro would be granted a 68 percent stake in a new joint venture (JV) named the Sino–Congolais des Mines (Sicomines SARL), and a Congolese parastatal called Générale des Carrières et des Mine SARL (Gécamines SARL) would own the other 32 percent. In exchange, the CREC and Sinohydro would provide the Government of the DRC with turnkey public infrastructure projects (worth $6.56 billion) financed by China Eximbank. The terms of lending were not identified in the “protocol d’accord”. Then, on April 22, 2008, a “convention de collaboration” (Chinese name: 关于刚果民主共和国矿业开发和基础设施建设的合作协议) was signed by the Government of the DRC and Sinohydro (on behalf of Sicomines). It specified that two tranches of infrastructure financing—reportedly worth $3 billion each—would be disbursed and that subsidiary loans approved under the first tranche and second tranche would carry the following terms: a 25-year maturity and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus 100 basis points (or 3.839% at the time of the agreement). Principal repayments were not scheduled to commence until 2018, which implies a grace period of 10 years. The proceeds from these loans would be disbursed to the Chinese contractors responsible for individual infrastructure projects. The April 2008 agreement specified that ownership of the Sicomines joint venture was allocated such that CREC holds 43% ownership of the joint venture, Sinohydro holds 25%, Gécamines holds 20%, and a Mr. Gilbert Kalam Babanika (who was eventually appointed as deputy head of Sicomines) holds 12%.   On June 28, 2008, an amendment to the agreement was signed, which change the ownership allocation to CREC: 28%, Sinohydro: 20%, China Metallurgical Group Corporation: 20%, Gécamines: 20%, Mr. Gilbert Kalam Babanika: 12%. On September 11, 2008, a second amendment was signed, which further changed the ownership allocation to CREC: 33%, Sinohydro: 30%, Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt: 5%, Gécamines: 20%, Mr. Gilbert Kalam Babanika: 12%. Project ID#450 provides a list of the infrastructure projects and subsidiary loans that have been approved to date. Additionally, as part of the April 22, 2008 “convention de collaboration,” it was reported that the Chinese company consortium were to provide $2.9 billion in loans to cover (1) a $32 million loan to Gécamines to cover its initial capital injection to Sicomines (the total registered capital of Sicomines in 2008 was $100 million); (2) $50 million loan to Gécamines to procure supplies; and (3) to provide a shareholder loan for the development of the copper and cobalt mine at Kolwezi. The $2.9 billion was ultimately provided through a $870.1 million, interest-free shareholder loan (prêt d’actionnaire) from China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), Sinohydro Corporation and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt, and a $2.0299 billion loan from China Eximbank with a fixed interest rate of 6.1% and a 25-year maturity, a $50 million loan from Sicomines SARL to Gécamines, and a $32 million loan from Sicomines SARL to Gécamines. Project ID#73204 captures the interest-free shareholder loan from China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), Sinohydro Corporation and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt. Project ID#73145 captures the loan from China Eximbank. The $50 million loan from Sicomines SARL to Gécamines is captured via Project ID#91873.  The $32 million loan from Sicomines SARL to Gécamines is captured via Project ID#91875. At the end of Fiscal Year 2013, Sino–Congolais des Mines (Sicomines SARL) disclosed that it had received loan disbursements worth $423,889,454. However, it did not disclose if these disbursements came from the China Eximbank loan, the interest-free shareholder loan (prêt d’actionnaire) from China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC) and Sinohydro Corporation, both loans, or other loans/sources. The Congolese government agreed to provide a sovereign guarantee for both the ‘infrastructure loan’ and the ‘mining loan’ from China Eximbank. Another unique feature of the April 22, 2008 agreement was the inclusion of a $350 million signing bonus from the consortium of Chinese firms.   However, following pressure from the IMF and civil society, an amendment (Avenant No. 3 à la Convention de Collaboration Relative au Developpement d’un Projet Minier et d’un Projet d’Infrastructures en République Démocratique du Congo du 22 Avril 2008) was made to the “convention de collaboration” in October 2009. It reduced size of the infrastructure loan from $6 billion to $3,003,830,000 and removed the sovereign guarantee for the copper and cobalt mining loan from China Eximbank (captured via Project ID#73145). The sovereign guarantee for the infrastructure loan was left in place. China Eximbank was not a party to this amended agreement, which specified that if the floating (market) interest rate on the infrastructure loan (LIBOR plus 100 basis points) rose higher than the rate (4.4%) referenced in the April 22, 2008 “convention de collaboration”, an expanded consortium of Chinese firms (CREC, Sinohydro, and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt Company Ltd) would assume responsibility for the additional interest payments. The profits from the investment by SICOMINES SARL in the copper and cobalt mine at Kolwezi would be used to repay the loans that finance the costs of developing the copper and cobalt mine and the unrelated infrastructure projects. However, nearly four years after the October 2009 amendment was signed, the Congolese parliament had still not ratified it and China Eximbank became concerned about the risk of non-repayment. In order to limit its risk exposure, China Eximbank suggested that it take over Gécamines’ 32 percent ownership stake and that the Chinese consortium’s 68 percent ownership stake be mortgaged until the infrastructure and mining loans were repaid. The Congolese government rejected these proposed changes, and China Eximbank responded by rescinding its funding in early 2012. Then, the Chinese firms began negotiating with two alternative financiers: China Development Bank and the Bank of China. In July 2013, China Eximbank reversed its decision to halt funding for development of a copper and cobalt mine in Kolwezi.  Construction of the copper and cobalt mine in Kolwezi began in April 2013, and on November 6, 2015 the first phase of the mining project was completed. The first phase of the mining project achieved full-capacity production and became profitable in April 2016. The second phase commenced at some point between August 2019 and May 21, 2020. Upon completion of the project’s second phase, the mine’s annual copper output is expected to reach 250,000 metric tons (if it runs at full capacity).   According to the Sino-Congolese Program Coordination and Monitoring Office (BCPSC), by the end of 2020, the $2.0299 billion China Eximbank mining loan had achieved a 102.8% disbursement rate ($2,088,350,000 out of $2,029,900,000). In total, the loan disbursed $175 million in 2009, $265.3 million in 2010, $7.93 million in 2011, $190.65 million in 2012, $208.91 million in 2013, $526.2 million in 2014, $154.68 million in 2015, $18.74 million in 2016, $11.26 million in 2017, $6.8 million in 2018, $45.76 million in 2019, and $477.11 million in 2020. According to BCPSC, Sicomines SARL made debt service payments (worth $550.14 million) on the $2.0299 billion China Eximbank mining loan between 2009 and 2020: $8.28 million in 2009, $19.997 million in 2010, $20.49 million in 2011, $7.22 million in 2012, $25.31 million in 2013, $54.31 million in 2014, $68.96 million in 2015, $72.28 million in 2016, $69.61 million in 2017, $66.11 million in 2018, $62.7 million in 2019, and $74.4 million in 2020.

As of June 29, 2015, the loan's total (principal) amount outstanding was $2,337,876,519.   The purpose of the project was to construct the Baha Mar Resort, a 1,000-acre (400 hectare) resort complex on the island of New Providence in The Bahamas. Once completed and fully operational, the project was expected to include the following four new hotels with 2,323 guest rooms (inclusive of 284 condos and villas), a casino, and a convention center:   (a) Baha Mar Casino & Hotel: A 100,000 square foot Las Vegas-style casino and premiere hotel with 1,068 rooms and suites, designed to appeal to international casino clientele, and boasting dedicated VIP entrances, suite levels, and VIP/premium gaming areas. The Baha Mar Resort is located in Nassau in the Bahamas. Once the project was completed, the Baha Mar Casino & Hotel was to be operated by GGAM Bahamas Holdings, LLC.

In addition, the hotel has certain for-sale residential condominium and villa units, a number of which are under contract.   China Construction America (CCA) -- a subsidiary of China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) -- was appointed as the main contractor for the project. The project sponsor (BML Properties) and CSEC jointly developed the project. CSCEC took a minority ownership stake in the project. A formal groundbreaking ceremony took place on February 21, 2011. Then, on November 11, 2011, traffic on West Bay Street was diverted to flow freely around the perimeter of the project site. On June 9, 2014, fifty CCA workers protested outside the Chinese Embassy in Nassau, claiming that they had not been paid in six months. Then, on August 1, 2014, Baha Mar Ltd announced that the grand opening of the resort would not take place in December 2014 (as originally scheduled). On October 1, 2014, Bahamian contractors disclosed that it was 'a grind' to obtain timely payment from CCA for work done on the Baha Mar project, with wait times of 90-120 days affecting their cash flow and eating into already-thin profit margins. Then, on March 24, 2015, Baha Mar Ltd issued a statement saying the resort’s opening will have to be pushed back, claiming inferior quality work by CCA. By June 2015, the project had achieved a 97% completion rate. However, on June 30, 2015, Baha Mar Ltd announced that it has commenced a claim in the English High Court in London against CCA’s parent company, CSCEC, seeking $192 million worth of damages for late payments and poor workmanship. Then, after temporarily suspending work, CCA returned to Baha Mar site to assess the work needed to complete the project in September 2015. At the time, 120 local Bahamian contractors were demanding payments worth $74.3 million for work already done before resuming work on the resort. The Baha Mar resort officially opened on April 14, 2017. However, the resort did not begin taking paying guests until June 1, 2018. The project's originally scheduled construction commencement date was September 19, 2011 and its originally scheduled construction completion date was December 8, 2014. The resort was originally expected to open on March 27, 2015  The China Eximbank loan that was issued for the project has financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. On June 29, 2015, with the Baha Mar resort 97% complete, Baha Mar Ltd., the developer of the resort, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Delaware. The underlying cause of the filing was a commercial dispute between Baha Mar Ltd. and its construction company. In November 2015, the Bahamas Supreme Court named Deloitte & Touche LLP as a receiver to Baha Mar Ltd. at the request of the Export-Import Bank of China, which is a primary creditor having made a $2.45 billion loan to Baha Mar Ltd. in 2010. In March 2016, the receiver engaged Colliers International, an international real estate firm, to actively market the resort to a new owner. A U.S. judge eventually dismissed the Chapter 11 case brought by Baha Mar's Bahamian companies. On August 23, 2016 the Prime Minister of the Bahamas, Perry Christie, announced that the Government of the Bahamas and the Export-Import Bank of China had signed an agreement to complete construction of the Baha Mar mega-resort. Construction at the resort had been stalled for 20 months. The Export-Import Bank of China created a special purpose vehicle (SPV) called Perfect Luck Holdings to purchase Baha Mar’s real estate assets out of receivership, which was the first step towards completing the project’s physical construction prior to its sale to the ‘ultimate buyer’. At the same time, the original Baha Mar companies were placed into full liquidation under the supervision of the Supreme Court and the former provisional liquidators. These two developments threatened to cost Sarkis Izmirlian and his family their total $800-$900 million equity investment in building up the Baha Mar project over the past 13 years. Then, on August 22, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Bahamas signed a 'Heads of Terms Agreement' to facilitate the remobilization, completion of construction, and the opening, operation and eventual sale of the Baha Mar Resort -- a part of which involved setting up a fund to pay the majority of the Bahamian unsecured creditors (including the utility providers) in return for which the Government of the Bahamas granted valuable tax and others concessions. The 'Heads of Terms Agreement' provided for the following: (i) a commitment by the China Eximbank to the immediate resumption and completion of construction of the resort, and the opening of the Casino, Casino Hotel, Convention Centre and Golf Course; (ii) a commitment from China Eximbank to fund the remaining construction costs; (iii) the establishment of a voluntary fund of $101.5 million to pay the majority of unsecured creditors, including Bahamian government utility corporations; (iv) the establishment of a Claims Committee to oversee the payment process for unsecured creditors; and (iv) the establishment of deadlines for the commencement of construction, and the completion of various steps needed to accomplish the completion, opening and sale of the Resort. Effective November 30, 2016, Chow Tai Fook Enterprises Limited (CTFEL) and CTF BM entered into a share purchase agreement with The Export-Import Bank of China and Perfect Luck Investments Limited for the sale and purchase of the Baha Mar Project.","Completion","Mixed","Loan","OOF-like","BUSINESS AND OTHER SERVICES","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company",3412180992.70078,"The Baha Mar Resort is located in Nassau in the Bahmas.

The borrowing terms of this loan are unknown. However, it is known that this loan was repaid ahead of schedule (on June 30, 2017) as part of a debt refinancing agreement with China Development Bank (captured via Project #53063). It is also known that the loan was to be serviced and secured with the proceeds from the sale of 10,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil in 2010, 40,000 bpd between 2011-2013, and 30,000 bpd between 2014-2016.   The loan proceeds were used to be used by the borrower partially finance a $3.535 billion commercial (EPC) contract for the construction of the Kilamba Kiaxi housing district, which is 30 kilometers southwest of Luanda and has a capacity to accommodate 200,000-500,000 people. The project involved the construction of 710 buildings with 20,002 apartments, 246 shops, 24 kindergartens, 9 primary schools, 8 secondary schools, 2 electricity substations, 1 sewage treatment plant, 1 water treatment plant, primary and secondary municipal roads, and various municipal systems such as water supply, power supply, telecommunications, sewage, drainage, traffic signals, etc.   CITIC Construction — a subsidiary of CITIC Group, a Chinese state owned conglomerate — was the contractor responsible for project design and implementation. It signed the EPC contract on November 14, 2007 and a groundbreaking ceremony took place on August 31, 2008.  A total of 60,000 workers implemented this project, 60% of whom were Angolan workers. The originally scheduled completion date of the project was April 2012 but the project was ultimately completed on September 17, 2012.  According to CITIC, the housing project had achieved a 75% occupancy rate by May 2014. However, in August 2010, the President of Angola promised that the state-subsidized housing units would be sold to Angolan families for a maximum price of $60,000, and the units were ultimately marketed at price points (between $125,000 – $200,000) that were two to three times the promised price point and well beyond the means of the families for which they were ostensibly intended.

The total cost of the project was $5.9 billion (RMB 37.4 billion) and it was financed according to 60:40 debt-to-equity ratio ($3.54 billion of debt and $2.36 billion of equity).  LCRC directly secured $3.54 billion (RMB 22.45 billion) of debt financing from the Export-Import Bank of China in June 2019 (captured via Project ID#85304), and the Government of Laos and the Chinese Government jointly contributed $730 million and $1.63 billion of equity financing, respectively, for the project. The $3.54 billion debt financing package was reportedly secured by (collateralized against) an equity pledge, an asset mortgage, and a franchise pledge.  In order to make its $730 million equity contribution to the project, the Government of Laos secured a $480 million loan from China Eximbank (captured via Project ID#33726) and it agreed to provide $250 million of its own funding (in annual installments). China Eximbank and the Government of Laos signed the $480 million loan agreement on September 8, 2016. The loan carried the following borrowing terms: an interest rate of 2.3%, maturity period of 25 years, and a grace period of 5 years. The Government of Laos did not issue a sovereign guarantee in support of the loan, but it did pledge revenues from a bauxite mine and three potash mines in Laos as sources of collateral to secure the loan. An intergovernmental framework agreement on November 13, 2015 preceded the signing of this loan agreement.  The purpose of the project was to construct a 418 mile long railway segment that connects Kunming, the capital city of southwestern China’s Yunnan Province, with Laos’ capital city of Vientiane. This railway segment passed through the capital of Vientiane and the four Laotian provinces of Luangnamtha, Oudomxay, Luang Prabang, and Vientiane. It was part of a larger Kunming-Singapore Railway Project (also known as the Kunming-Singapore Trans Asian Railway Corridor), which starts from Kunming and ends in Singapore after passing through Laos, Thailand, and Malaysia.  The single-track electrified rail line has a designed speed of 160 km/hour and it is being built in standard gauge. 47% percent of the railway passes through 75 tunnels and 15% passed over viaducts spread over 167 bridges. There were 32 planned stations along the route, and according to the Ministry of Public Works and Transport of Laos, 50 meters of land on either side of the tracks was reserved for the railway's developers. The final station was Thanaleng station. Xay Village in Xaythany District was to be the site of Vientiane Station, the largest station on the railway. Upon completion, the Laos-China Railway was expected to reduce the time necessary to travel from Mohan-Boten to Vientiane from three days to less than three hours. According to a 2012 feasibility study, the internal rate of return (IRR) of the project was projected to be 4.56%. Sinohydro Corporation, Power Construction Corporation of China, China Railway No. 5 Group, China Railway No. 2 Group, and China Railway No. 8 Group were the contractors responsible for implementation.   The formal start of works was announced in December 2015. However, progress was initially slow due to unresolved property issues as well as detailed design works. A groundbreaking ceremony did not take place until December 25, 2016. (Note: An earlier groundbreaking ceremony was abandoned in 2011 after reports emerged that China was demanding large land concessions along the railway line in return for funding its construction.) Large scale implementation began in the summer of 2017. By mid-2018, the project had achieved a 20% completion rate. Then, on March 27, 2020, the first 500-meter-long track segment was successfully laid in Vientiane. Construction of the Vientiane Railway Station commenced on July 3, 2020.   Railway infrastructure was reportedly 90% complete as of July 2020. On October 6, 2021, the China-Laos railway station opened in Vientiane. The project was completed on October 12, 2021, and was put into commercial use later in December 2020. Then, on October 16, 2021, the first train made its public debut in Vientiane, ahead of a test run. The originally expected project completion date was December 2, 2021.

China Eximbank agreed to cover 82% of the total project cost, with the Government of Pakistan covering the remaining 18%. This 'mixed credit' arrangement produced four different financial commitments: two preferential buyer's credits (PBC), one government concessional loan (GCL), and one buyer's credit loan (BCL). On January 14, 2014, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed a $382,848,800 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2013) 50 TOTAL NO. (294)]. Its borrowing terms are unknown (captured via Project ID#92413).

The PBC carried the following borrowing terms: a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 8 year grace period (captured via Project ID#41918). This agreement was amended on October 8, 2019 [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (15) 18 TOTAL NO. (360) (A)], but the purpose of the amendment is unknown. Additionally, on December 18, 2015, the Government of Pakistan and China Eximbank signed a $2.25 billion buyer’s credit loan (BCL) [Government of Pakistan loan ID#BC-BLA201401 and BCL 2015212932] carrying a 6% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and a 8 year grace period (captured via Project ID#41917).  The Government of Pakistan on-lent some or all of the proceeds of the China Eximbank loans to Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) -- a federally funded independent governmental agency -- at a 15% interest rate. The Government of Pakistan also reportedly issued sovereign guarantees for all four China Eximbank loans that supported the project. In December 2015, the amounts outstanding under all four China Eximbank loans (worth $5.668 billion) were reportedly transferred by the Government of Pakistan to PAEC (as the direct borrower).   The purpose of the project was to construct units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP), which is located in Paradise Point in Karachi within Sindh Province.  China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. It is using Hualon One technology (the CNNC's third-generation nuclear reactor design) to construct Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on November 26, 2013. Then, a major milestone was reached at the K-2 reactor when so-called ‘cold functional tests’ began on November 26, 2019. Cold functional tests are carried out to confirm whether the main system and its supporting facilities are properly installed and ready to operate under high-pressure conditions. K-2 was ultimately connected to the national grid on March 18, 2021. It was officially inaugurated on May 21, 2021 and put into operation on May 24, 2021. The K-3 reactor came online on March 4, 2022. The project was originally expected to reach completion by the end of 2020.  There are some indications that the $3.618 billion China Eximbank preferential buyer's credit for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of the lender. In May 2019, PAEC sought the Prime Minister's approval to have the interest rates of the China Eximbank loans for Units 2 and 3 of the KANUPP Project reset to their original levels (when they were first issued by China Eximbank). Local sources reported at the time that the electricity tariff determined by the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) was set on the basis of actual electricity generation costs and on-lending at a 15% rate increased actual electricity generation costs by PKR 108 billion (necessitating an PKR 1.8/kWh increase in the tariff rate). However, it is unclear if the Prime Minister approved PAEC’s request. Then, on or around July 1, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a debt suspension agreement. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between July 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020 under the $3.618 billion preferential buyer's credit agreement for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. Then, on November 19, 2020, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement [No. DSSI2021PHASE1-031]. Under the terms of the agreement, the lender agreed to suspend principal and interest payments due between January 1, 2021 and June 30, 2021 under the $3.618 billion preferential buyer's credit agreement for Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) Project. Then, on or around July 1, 2021, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed another debt suspension agreement.

Then, in April 2022, local media reported that the operation of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant and the repayment of the China Eximbank loans that supported its construction had become a challenge due the absence of requisite payments from the Government of Pakistan's Central Power Purchasing Agency–Guaranteed (CPPA-G).

As part of the transaction, Turkmengaz reportedly agreed to supply China with up to 40 billion cubic meters/year of natural gas for 30 years. Turkmengaz agreed to use the revenue it earned from a natural gas supply contract as a source of collateral. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance an EPC contract between Turkmengaz and CNPC, which was signed on December 29, 2009.

The project involved the construction of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant — with 3 liquefaction trains and an annual production capacity of 16.5 million tons per annum based on the feedstock resources of the South-Tambeyskoye field — located in Sabetta at the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula. In addition to the LNG plant, the project included production at the Yuzhno-Tambeyskoye gas field, and the transport infrastructure, including the Sabetta seaport and airport. The Sabetta port is strategically located on the west bank of the Ob Bay, on the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug (YNAO). Its construction was designed to allow Novatek — Russia's second-largest (private) natural gas producer — to boost its exports to China and other Asian countries to compete with Russia’s number one gas producer Gazprom.   Technip France (France) and JGC Corporation (Japan), acting as one consortium, were the EPC contractors responsible for implementation. They are among the leading international engineering and construction companies with vast experience in front-end engineering design and execution of engineering, procurement and construction contracts for LNG plants worldwide. One of their subcontractors was China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). A groundbreaking ceremony for the Sabetta seaport was held on or around July 23, 2012; however, construction of the seaport did not begin until 2013. Despite the fact that the Russian government does not have an ownership stake in the borrowing institution (JSC Yamal LNG), when the project stalled in 2015 because of Western sanctions on Novatek, the Russian government quietly injected 150 billion rubles (approximately EUR 2.1 billion) into JSC Yamal LNG by tapping its rainy-day fund (the so-called “National Wealth Fund”). The Russian government never provided an explicit justification for the bailout, but Leonid Michelson and Gennady Timchenko are major shareholders of Novatek and personal friends of Vladimir Putin. As of April 2016, construction of the LNG plant was 65% complete. LNG production began on December 5, 2016. Then, on December 8, 2017, the commercial operation of the port and first LNG train (LNG purification facility) were launched by starting loading the first LNG carrier named after the late CEO of Total Christophe de Margerie. The loading was ceremonially launched by president Vladimir Putin in the presence of Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih. Then, in August 2018, the second production line (liquefaction train) of the LNG plant was launched. In November 2018, the third production line (liquefaction train) of the LNG plant was launched.   Yamal LNG has commissioned 15 LNG icebreaker/tanker ships to export its gas. Each icebreaker/tanker is designed to operate year-round from the Yamal peninsula and to break ice up to 2.5 meters thick. The ships are leased by Yamal LNG from four companies: Sovcomflot, one ship; MOL, three ships; Dynagas, five ships; and Teekay, six ships.  The tankers were designed in Finland by Aker Arctic Technology Inc. and built at the Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) shipyard in South Korea. The first icebreaker, Christophe de Margerie, traversed from Norway to South Korea across the Northern Sea Route in 19 days in August 2017.  When ice precludes shipping along the Northern Sea Route, then the Fluxys terminal at Zeebrugge, Belgium, will serve Russia as the LNG port for the Asia-Pacific region. Following the September 14, 2019 attack by Iran on Saudi Arabian oil fields at Khurais and Abqaiq (Biqayq in Arabic) during the 2019–2021 Persian Gulf crisis, the United States Government imposed sanctions under executive order 13846 against several companies including Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Seaman and Ship Management Company Ltd and the Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian (大連中遠海運油品運輸有限公司) which are two Cosco Shipping Company subsidiaries that are supporting LNG shipments from Sabetta. As of late September 2019, the Joint Venture TC LNG between the Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian company (50% stake) and the Canadian firm Teekay is the China LNG Shipping Ltd (CLNG) which has more than one third of Sabetta's LNG ice fleet, six ARC7 LNG tankers: Eduard Toll (Russian: «Эдуард Толль»), Rudolf Samoilovich (Russian: «Рудольф Самойлович»), Nikolay Evgenov (Russian: «Николай Евгенов»), Vladimir Voronin (Russian: «Владимир Воронин») all of which are operating, Georgy Ushakov (Russian: «Георгий Ушаков») which is going to Sabetta after sea trials, and Yakov Gakkel (Russian: «Яков Гаккель») which is under sea trials at a South Korean shipyard. Also affected were five ARC7 tankers which Dynagas will supply in a partnership between Sinotrans&CSC and CLNG (25.5% stake), as well as three ARC7 tankers from a joint venture between the Cosco subsidiary Shanghai LNG and Japan's MOL (株式会社商船三井). However, these former five and later three ARC7 tankers were not directly sanctioned but US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) rules require caution to be exercised in the former. Of the fifteen ARC7 tankers operating out of Sabetta, only Sovcomflot's Christophe de Margerie was not affected by the sanctions. Although these ships had been serviced at Honningsvåg, Norway, this was to be phased out and future LNG tanker shipments along the Northern Sea Route may occur between Murmansk and Kamchatka in Russia coastal waters.  On January 30, 2020, the United States Government lifted sanctions on Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) and its TC LNG.  There are some indications that Yamal LNG Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of its lenders. In February 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued Directive 3 Under Executive Order 14024, which prohibited U.S. persons from engaging in all transactions in, provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of greater than 14 days maturity and new equity issued by 13 Russian state-owned enterprises and entities, as well as their subsidiaries, on or after March 26, 2022. The entities included Transneft, Sberbank, AlfaBank, Credit Bank of Moscow, Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Rostelecom, RusHydro, Alrosa, Sovcomflot, and Russian Railways. Then, on March 5, 2022, the Russian Government issued Presidential Decree No. 95, which required that Russian borrowers make payments to foreign creditors from ‘unfriendly states’—including most countries that imposed sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine—in Russian rubles (irrespective of the currency of the loan), unless a permission to make direct payments in the contractual currency was granted by either the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) or Russia’s Ministry of Finance. This measure made it substantially more difficult for Russian borrowers to make timely payments on foreign- and local-currency debt to certain international creditors in their original currencies of denomination. In June 2022, the Russian Government defaulted on some of its dollar-denominated and euro-denominated debt.   The fact that at least two of OAO Yamal LNG's lenders (Sberbank and Gazprombank) faced international sanctions in 2022 and 2023 likely complicated loan repayment. Poten & Partners -- a firm that advises clients that are active in the international oil, gas and shipping markets -- noted in March 2022 that that 'latest round of sanctions has left Russian LNG sector companies and the domestic and foreign companies that provide finance and services to them struggling to assess their liabilities and exposure to counterparties. [...] Providers of the approximately [$20 billion] debt package for Yamal LNG included China Exim, CDB, Sberbank, Gazprombank, Russia’s National Wealth Fund (NWF), Russia’s ECA, Exiar, with smaller portions coming from Germany’s Euler Hermes, Sweden’s EKN, Austria’s Raiffeisen, JBIC and Intesa San Paolo. State development bank VEB also provided a US$3Bn guarantee to the project. Some of the Russian entities on the financing, including VEB, NWF and Exiar are now faced with sanctions. Novatek owns a 50.1% stake, with TotalEnergies and CNPC each holding 20% and China’s Silk Road Fund the remaining 9.9%. As the operating Yamal LNG project continues to service its loans, with a core group of lenders in Yamal LNG subject to sanctions, it will complicate arrangements. Parties who have contracts with the project such as shippers, suppliers and contractors are also potentially exposed to sanctions. It puts shareholders in a difficult position over whether to try and replace sanctioned entities. When Novatek and its partners were looking to raise funding for Yamal LNG, Russia’s annexation of Crimea forced them to makeover their financing plan. Financial advisor Societe Generale, and legal advisors White & Case and Latham & Watkins exited the project in 2014 and the financing was reworked to maximise support from Chinese and Russian lenders. It focused on using euros, Russian roubles and Chinese renminbi rather than US dollars to reduce sanctions risks. In its new form, the financing was successful, even though Novatek was subject to limited and defined US sanctions. But with the current round of restrictive measures, conditions are more challenging.'","Completion","Commercial","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Other Private Sector|Recipient Private Sector|Other Private Sector",5589036080.71159,"This project involves the construction a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant located in Sabetta at the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula.

As part of the transaction, Turkmengaz reportedly agreed to supply China with up to 40 billion cubic meters/year of natural gas for 30 years. Turkmengaz agreed to use the revenue it earned from a natural gas supply contract as a source of collateral. The borrower was expected to use the proceeds of the loan to partially finance an EPC contract between Turkmengaz and CNPC, which was signed on December 29, 2009.

In July 2016, OAO Yamal LNG withdrew a combined 450 million euros from the euro-dominated facilities of CDB and China Eximbank. The individual amounts withdrawn from each facility are unknown. The Yamal Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) Project is also being financed with a $3.069 billion loan (with a 15 year maturity) from Sberbank, a $1.023 billion loan (with a 15 year maturity) from Gazprombank, a Sinosure-insured EUR 730 million loan (with a 15 year maturity) from the Silk Road Fund (captured in Project ID#67040), an equity investment worth EUR 1.087 billion from the Silk Road Fund (captured in Project ID#67068), and an equity investment worth $5.513 billion by CNPC (captured in Project ID#67069).   The project involved the construction of a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant — with 3 liquefaction trains and an annual production capacity of 16.5 million tons per annum based on the feedstock resources of the South-Tambeyskoye field — located in Sabetta at the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula. In addition to the LNG plant, the project included production at the Yuzhno-Tambeyskoye gas field, and the transport infrastructure, including the Sabetta seaport and airport. The Sabetta port is strategically located on the west bank of the Ob Bay, on the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula in the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous Okrug (YNAO). Its construction was designed to allow Novatek — Russia's second-largest (private) natural gas producer — to boost its exports to China and other Asian countries to compete with Russia’s number one gas producer Gazprom.   Technip France (France) and JGC Corporation (Japan), acting as one consortium, were the EPC contractors responsible for implementation. They are among the leading international engineering and construction companies with vast experience in front-end engineering design and execution of engineering, procurement and construction contracts for LNG plants worldwide. One of their subcontractors was China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). A groundbreaking ceremony for the Sabetta seaport was held on or around July 23, 2012; however, construction of the seaport did not begin until 2013. Despite the fact that the Russian government does not have an ownership stake in the borrowing institution (JSC Yamal LNG), when the project stalled in 2015 because of Western sanctions on Novatek, the Russian government quietly injected 150 billion rubles (approximately EUR 2.1 billion) into JSC Yamal LNG by tapping its rainy-day fund (the so-called “National Wealth Fund”). The Russian government never provided an explicit justification for the bailout, but Leonid Michelson and Gennady Timchenko are major shareholders of Novatek and personal friends of Vladimir Putin. As of April 2016, construction of the LNG plant was 65% complete. LNG production began on December 5, 2016. Then, on December 8, 2017, the commercial operation of the port and first LNG train (LNG purification facility) were launched by starting loading the first LNG carrier named after the late CEO of Total Christophe de Margerie. The loading was ceremonially launched by president Vladimir Putin in the presence of Saudi Arabia's energy minister Khalid al-Falih. Then, in August 2018, the second production line (liquefaction train) of the LNG plant was launched. In November 2018, the third production line (liquefaction train) of the LNG plant was launched.   Yamal LNG has commissioned 15 LNG icebreaker/tanker ships to export its gas. Each icebreaker/tanker is designed to operate year-round from the Yamal peninsula and to break ice up to 2.5 meters thick. The ships are leased by Yamal LNG from four companies: Sovcomflot, one ship; MOL, three ships; Dynagas, five ships; and Teekay, six ships.  The tankers were designed in Finland by Aker Arctic Technology Inc. and built at the Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering (DSME) shipyard in South Korea. The first icebreaker, Christophe de Margerie, traversed from Norway to South Korea across the Northern Sea Route in 19 days in August 2017.  When ice precludes shipping along the Northern Sea Route, then the Fluxys terminal at Zeebrugge, Belgium, will serve Russia as the LNG port for the Asia-Pacific region. Following the September 14, 2019 attack by Iran on Saudi Arabian oil fields at Khurais and Abqaiq (Biqayq in Arabic) during the 2019–2021 Persian Gulf crisis, the United States Government imposed sanctions under executive order 13846 against several companies including Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) Seaman and Ship Management Company Ltd and the Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian (大連中遠海運油品運輸有限公司) which are two Cosco Shipping Company subsidiaries that are supporting LNG shipments from Sabetta. As of late September 2019, the Joint Venture TC LNG between the Cosco Shipping Tanker Dalian company (50% stake) and the Canadian firm Teekay is the China LNG Shipping Ltd (CLNG) which has more than one third of Sabetta's LNG ice fleet, six ARC7 LNG tankers: Eduard Toll (Russian: «Эдуард Толль»), Rudolf Samoilovich (Russian: «Рудольф Самойлович»), Nikolay Evgenov (Russian: «Николай Евгенов»), Vladimir Voronin (Russian: «Владимир Воронин») all of which are operating, Georgy Ushakov (Russian: «Георгий Ушаков») which is going to Sabetta after sea trials, and Yakov Gakkel (Russian: «Яков Гаккель») which is under sea trials at a South Korean shipyard. Also affected were five ARC7 tankers which Dynagas will supply in a partnership between Sinotrans&CSC and CLNG (25.5% stake), as well as three ARC7 tankers from a joint venture between the Cosco subsidiary Shanghai LNG and Japan's MOL (株式会社商船三井). However, these former five and later three ARC7 tankers were not directly sanctioned but US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) rules require caution to be exercised in the former. Of the fifteen ARC7 tankers operating out of Sabetta, only Sovcomflot's Christophe de Margerie was not affected by the sanctions. Although these ships had been serviced at Honningsvåg, Norway, this was to be phased out and future LNG tanker shipments along the Northern Sea Route may occur between Murmansk and Kamchatka in Russia coastal waters.  On January 30, 2020, the United States Government lifted sanctions on Cosco Shipping Tanker (Dalian) and its TC LNG.  There are some indications that Yamal LNG Project may have financially underperformed vis-a-vis the original expectations of its lenders. In February 2022, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued Directive 3 Under Executive Order 14024, which prohibited U.S. persons from engaging in all transactions in, provision of financing for, and other dealings in new debt of greater than 14 days maturity and new equity issued by 13 Russian state-owned enterprises and entities, as well as their subsidiaries, on or after March 26, 2022. The entities included Transneft, Sberbank, AlfaBank, Credit Bank of Moscow, Gazprombank, Russian Agricultural Bank, Gazprom, Gazprom Neft, Rostelecom, RusHydro, Alrosa, Sovcomflot, and Russian Railways. Then, on March 5, 2022, the Russian Government issued Presidential Decree No. 95, which required that Russian borrowers make payments to foreign creditors from ‘unfriendly states’—including most countries that imposed sanctions on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine—in Russian rubles (irrespective of the currency of the loan), unless a permission to make direct payments in the contractual currency was granted by either the Central Bank of the Russian Federation (CBR) or Russia’s Ministry of Finance. This measure made it substantially more difficult for Russian borrowers to make timely payments on foreign- and local-currency debt to certain international creditors in their original currencies of denomination. In June 2022, the Russian Government defaulted on some of its dollar-denominated and euro-denominated debt.   The fact that at least two of OAO Yamal LNG's lenders (Sberbank and Gazprombank) faced international sanctions in 2022 and 2023 likely complicated loan repayment. Poten & Partners -- a firm that advises clients that are active in the international oil, gas and shipping markets -- noted in March 2022 that that 'latest round of sanctions has left Russian LNG sector companies and the domestic and foreign companies that provide finance and services to them struggling to assess their liabilities and exposure to counterparties. [...] Providers of the approximately [$20 billion] debt package for Yamal LNG included China Exim, CDB, Sberbank, Gazprombank, Russia’s National Wealth Fund (NWF), Russia’s ECA, Exiar, with smaller portions coming from Germany’s Euler Hermes, Sweden’s EKN, Austria’s Raiffeisen, JBIC and Intesa San Paolo. State development bank VEB also provided a US$3Bn guarantee to the project. Some of the Russian entities on the financing, including VEB, NWF and Exiar are now faced with sanctions. Novatek owns a 50.1% stake, with TotalEnergies and CNPC each holding 20% and China’s Silk Road Fund the remaining 9.9%. As the operating Yamal LNG project continues to service its loans, with a core group of lenders in Yamal LNG subject to sanctions, it will complicate arrangements. Parties who have contracts with the project such as shippers, suppliers and contractors are also potentially exposed to sanctions. It puts shareholders in a difficult position over whether to try and replace sanctioned entities. When Novatek and its partners were looking to raise funding for Yamal LNG, Russia’s annexation of Crimea forced them to makeover their financing plan. Financial advisor Societe Generale, and legal advisors White & Case and Latham & Watkins exited the project in 2014 and the financing was reworked to maximise support from Chinese and Russian lenders. It focused on using euros, Russian roubles and Chinese renminbi rather than US dollars to reduce sanctions risks. In its new form, the financing was successful, even though Novatek was subject to limited and defined US sanctions. But with the current round of restrictive measures, conditions are more challenging.'","Completion","Commercial","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION","Yes","State-owned Policy Bank","Chinese State-owned Company|Other Private Sector|Recipient Private Sector|Other Private Sector",6605188842.44763,"This project involves the construction a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant located in Sabetta at the north-east of the Yamal Peninsula.

85211,"China (People's Republic of)","Russia","Europe",2013,NA,"CNPC disburses $33 billion loan — via oil prepayment facility — to Rosneft for unspecified purposes","On June 21, 2013, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) and Rosneft — a Russian state-owned oil company — signed a $270 billion oil supply contract to increase oil deliveries to China under the condition of advance payment. The contract went into effect in late December 2013 after it was ratified by Russian law (Federal Law #352-FZ), passed by the Russian State Duma on December 10, 2013, approved by the country's Federal Council on December 18, 2013, and signed by the President of Russian Federation on December 20, 2013. Under the terms of the contract, Rosneft agreed to increase its supply of oil to China through the Russia-China Crude Pipeline (Eastern Route) by approximately 360 million tons — from 15 million tons per year in 2013 to 30 million tons per year by 2018. The term of the oil supply contract was 25 years, with the option of a 5-year extension. According to the terms of the contract, CNPC agreed to pay $60-70 billion in advance to Rosneft. Rosneft, in turn, agreed to repay CNPC at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 229 basis points. The $60-70 billion advance payment was scheduled to disburse in five tranches.   Multiple sources confirm that the first three tranches — worth approximately $33 billion — disbursed between 2013 and 2015. However, since it is unclear if the fourth or fifth tranches ever disbursed, AidData records the transaction amount as $33 billion for the time being. It is also unclear how the borrower used the proceeds of the loan, but at the time that the CNPC-Rosneft oil prepayment contract was announced in 2013, JP Morgan analysts told Reuters that ‘if confirmed, this would be a transformational event for the company's balance sheet: Rosneft could even potentially be able to show a net cash position, though working capital would be negative. The prepayment could minimize financing risks for the leveraged state-controlled oil company.","Implementation","Commercial","Loan","OOF-like","INDUSTRY, MINING, CONSTRUCTION",NA,"State-owned Company","Recipient State-owned Company",37225206222.2645,"CNPC disburses a loan to Rosneft, which is headquartered at Sofiyskaya Naberezhnaya, 26/1, Moscow, 117997.
